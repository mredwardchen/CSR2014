  "readme": "# NodeJS Google Spreadsheets Data API\n\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/google-spreadsheet.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/google-spreadsheet)\n\nA simple Node.js library to read and manipulate data in a Google Spreadsheet.\n\nWorks without authentication for read-only sheets or with auth for adding/editing/deleting data. Currently only supports list-based feeds (dealing with rows) as it seems more useful, but will probably add in cell-based feeds eventually.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install google-spreadsheet\n```\n\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n``` javascript\nvar GoogleSpreadsheet = require(\"google-spreadsheet\");\n\nvar my_sheet = new GoogleSpreadsheet('<spreadsheet key>');\n\n// without auth -- read only\n// # is worksheet id - IDs start at 1\nmy_sheet.getRows( 1, function(err, row_data){\n\tconsole.log( 'pulled in '+row_data.length + ' rows ')\n})\n\n// set auth to be able to edit/add/delete\nmy_sheet.setAuth('<google email/username>','<google pass>', function(err){\n\tmy_sheet.getInfo( function( err, sheet_info ){\n\t\tconsole.log( sheet_info.title + ' is loaded' );\n\t\t// use worksheet object if you want to forget about ids\n\t\tsheet_info.worksheets[0].getRows( function( err, rows ){\n\t\t\trows[0].colname = 'new val';\n\t\t\trows[0].save();\n\t\t\trows[0].del();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// column names are set by google based on the first row of your sheet\n\tmy_sheet.addRow( 2, { colname: 'col value'} );\n\n\tmy_sheet.getRows( 2, {\n\t\tstart: 100,\t\t\t// start index\n\t\tnum: 100\t\t\t// number of rows to pull\n\t}, function(err, row_data){\n\t\t// do something...\n\t});\n})\n```\n\n\n## A note on authentication\n\nThe Google Spreadsheets Data API reference and developers guide is a little ambiguous about how you access a \"published\" public Spreadsheet.\n\nIf you wish to work with a Google Spreadsheet without authenticating, not only \nmust the Spreadsheet in question be visible to the web, but it must also have \nbeen explicitly published using \"File > Publish to the web\" menu option in the google spreadsheets GUI.\n\nGenerally, you'll find alot of public spreadsheets may not have had this \ntreatment, so your best bet is to just authenticate a Google account and \naccess the API in that manner.\n\nThis library uses [googleclientlogin](https://github.com/Ajnasz/GoogleClientLogin) internally to provide basic authentication. Optionally you can pass in an auth token that you have created already (using googleclientlogin or something else).\n\n\n## Further possibilities & to-do\n\n- Adding cell-based feeds (was in the original package)\n- batch requests for cell based updates\n- modifying worksheet/spreadsheet properties\n- getting list of available spreadsheets for an authenticated user\n\n## Links\n\n- <https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/>\n- <https://github.com/Ajnasz/GoogleClientLogin>\n\n\n## Thanks\nThis is a fairly major rewrite of code by [samcday](https://github.com/samcday). original version [here](https://github.com/samcday/node-google-spreadsheets)\nAlso big thanks fo GoogleClientLogin for dealing with authentication.\n\n\n## License\nnode-google-spreadsheets is free and unencumbered public domain software.
