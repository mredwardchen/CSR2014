                        <b>Barcelona, Spain - August 3, 2017</b> - Nanusens has announced that its CMOS nano-sensor technology has been successfully used to solve the problem of stiction in MEMS inertial sensors, which is a major source of failure for this type of sensor. 
                        <BR/>
                        "Our first silicon nano-sensor samples from GLOBALFOUNDRIES exceeded our expectations showing outstanding resilience to stiction, with the devices going through more than 10,000 switching cycles, each equivalent to more than 1000G shocks," explained Nanusens' CEO, Dr Josep Montanyà i Silvestre.  "And the sensitivity is an order of magnitude above what is needed for a motion sensor in most applications."

Sensors found in these products include electronic compasses, motion sensors, barometers, microphones, and fingerprint sensors. Package types include land grid arrays (LGAs,), leadframe packages such QFNs, and wafer level packages (WLPs.). Apple is expected to account for 28 percent of the total smartphone sensor market as a result of increased sensor adoption. With the trend toward smart factories, industrial applications are also expected to account for increased sensor demand.
