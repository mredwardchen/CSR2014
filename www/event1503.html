                                        <h4> Report from BiTS 2015</h4>
                                            <p>

                                                The Burn-in and Test Strategies (BiTS) Workshop successfully completed its sixteenth annual event in Mesa, Arizona on March 18, 2015. Throughout the three-day event, attendees participated in a hands-on tutorial, a keynote address from Joe Bruen of Freescale Semiconductor, and an invited talk from Brandon Prior of Prismark Partners, as well as technical content from industry experts and participants.
                                               </p><p>
                                                Heidi Barnes lead the hands-on tutorial, “How to make a high-frequency transparent socket,” featuring Keysight Technologies’ hardware and software. The tutorial  offered participants a toolbox of both simulation measurement and signal integrity techniques for characterizing a socket and ways to make it transparent for upcoming multi-gigabit applications. The tutorial preceded the three-day workshop.

                                                Technical papers, delivered by such leading companies as Advantest, Amkor Technologies, Intel Corporation, Infineon Technologies, STMicroelectronics, Teradyne, Tyco Electronics, and Xcerra, covered topical areas as diverse as test and socket solutions for testing automotive radar devices, device reliability, and test solutions for both WLCSP and MEMS devices. Best Paper was awarded to “Designing sockets for ludicrous speed (80GHz)” by Don Thompson (R&D Altanova) and Jose Moreira (Advantest).

                                                The BiTS Workshop event, which was focused on the burn-in and test of packaged semiconductors, drew more than 350 attendees. Fabless and integrated device manufacturers, as well as companies from the supply chain delivering burn-in, test, and test consumable products, were well represented. More than 40% of attendees were from international locations. An important component of the workshop has long been the BiTS EXPO, which is open to not only conference attendees, but also industry and academic members of the community. Displays featured the latest products and services from such companies as premier sponsor Smiths Connectors and emeritus sponsor, Test Tooling Solutions Group.

                                                Market outlooks were delivered by representatives of Feldman Engineering and VLSI Research. Opportunities for networking and social activities rounded out the 2015 event. General Chair, Ira Feldman of Feldman Engineering, declared the event a success as he announced that attendance was up by ~10% from 2014’s event. In one of his addresses to the attendees, Mr. Feldman also announced that BiTS Workshop will hold a seminal Asian event in Shanghai in October, 2015. BiTS 2016 will return to Mesa, Arizona on March 6-9, 2016.
