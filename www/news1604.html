                                Those who were fortunate to have known Gene Selven recall a passionate, remarkable person in both business and leisure. His presence would fill a room—there was no escaping it. He was also passionate in everything he did. If you are new to the industry and didn’t know Gene, there are many still around from the “good old” days that worked with him. “Gene was a terrific icon in the electronics industry,” notes Mary Ann Olsson, an industry analyst who was introduced to Gene through industry colleagues. “One of my first bosses always told me to call Gene for the right answers. He was always sweet and helpful to me during the early years of my electronics research. He was a good soul!”

                                Born in Chicago, Illinois, Gene received his Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois in 1954, and then served in the U.S. Army from 1954-1956, stationed in Japan. Beginning his early career at IBM, he moved out of state to California as Manager of Product Marketing at Texas Instruments in the Semiconductor division. In 1969, he moved his residence to beautiful Portola Valley in Northern California where he began working as the Director of Product Marketing at Fairchild. In 1971, he joined the Semiconductor Division of Raytheon as Director of Marketing.

                                In 1976, Gene successfully started and grew his own company and expanded into publishing—purchasing the magazine Chip Scale Review from Tessera in 1999. His daughter, Kim, continues that legacy today. An early admirer of Gene, Tom Di Stefano of Centipede Systems remembers Gene as always generous and considerate. “Gene Selven built several publications into industry standards in his lifetime,” said Di Stefano. “In his most recent endeavor, he grew Chip Scale Review to a leading position in the semiconductor industry. As an advisor to the magazine, I was always delighted by Gene’s wisdom and insight in handling the many challenges that arose.”

                                Gene will be remembered as a true gentleman who kept his cool and resolve at all times—a true leader. Andrea Roberts of AR Marketing, says, “He was a wonderful man—and so passionate about the industry and communicating about it. I would always brighten up when I’d see him at a trade show. He was an institution in the industry, and although he was away from the industry for a number of years, he will be missed.”
                        </p><p>
                                Having traveled the world several times, Gene was an international traveler both in business and his personal life. An avid fisherman, he loved to fish on Lake Tulloch, and often traveled to Alaska over the years to catch halibut and salmon. Golf was another passion. The San Francisco 49ers and Giants were his favorite teams and he was a season ticket holder of both for many years. Having grown up with the Chicago White Sox, however, it bears “special mention” that he also considered that team to be his roots. Gene is survived by his two daughters, Kimberly Newman of Campbell, California, and Karen Williams of San Jose, California, grandson James Newman of Campbell, and his sister, Shirley Jensen of Lawton, Michigan. Services were held on March 30th. Donations can be made in Gene’s honor on the Alzheimer’s website on the (donate) tribute page under Gene Selven ( <a href="http://www.alz.org/"target="alz" >www.alz.org</a>).
