                            <h4>Management Changes - Annette Burczyk and Dr. Thorsten Teutsch assume new management duties for the PacTech Group 
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                <b>NAUEN, Germany</b> - As the Group has announced, Annette Burczyk and Dr. Thorsten Teutsch took over the executive management of the PacTech Group on April 1st, 2017.
                                Heinrich Lüdeke, who held the CEO position from 2013, stepped down at the end of March and will return to his former employer NAGASE (Europa) GmbH, Dusseldorf.<br/>
                                “I would like to thank Heinrich Lüdeke for the commitment and good achievements he has brought to the PacTech Group,” said Mr. Takahiro Okumura, Executive Officer of the parent company NAGASE (Japan).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Annette Burczyk, has more than 26 years of experience in taxation and financial matters where she held a number of key management positions, most recently as the Chief Financial Officer of the whole PacTech Group. Mrs. Burczyk will continue to oversee PacTech’s financial, HR, and administration department.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With more than 20 years of experience in the microelectronics field, Dr. Teutsch is a solid choice for the new leadership of the company. Dr. Teutsch began his professional career at PacTech in 1997, moving to PacTech USA in 2002, where he was ultimately appointed COO of the subsidiaries PacTech USA and PacTech Asia. As CEO, Dr. Teutsch will focus on engineering, quality, production, and sales & marketing of the PacTech Group.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “I can think of no one more qualified than Dr. Teutsch and Mrs. Burczyk to follow Mr. Luedeke as managing directors of PacTech,” commented Takahiro Okumura. “The combined experience of the new management and their outstanding work ethic will allow them to guide PacTech to new heights. All of us at NAGASE are excited about this move.”
