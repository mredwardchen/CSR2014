                                        Implementing 5G technology requires transmission of large amounts of data, reliable connections, quicker response time, and better coverage. Fully integrated RF front-end modules using a system in package (SiP) that includes antenna in package (AiP) technology, double-sided assembly, advanced wafer-level redistribution layer (RDL), passive component integration, and sophisticated RF shielding techniques provide the most advanced 5G package.

                                        the last six decades [1]. As Mooreâs Law begins to come to an end for not only fundamental reasons, but also for computing performance, 
                                        power, cost, and investments [2] (see Table 1), it is becoming clear that a different vision for electronics systems must emerge.</p>

                                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">The first step in this new vision is a shift from Mooreâs Law for integrated circuits(ICs) to Mooreâs Law for 
                                        Packaging by using package interconnections (I/Os) in2D, 2.5D and 3D between smaller chips with the same or higher transistor density, 
                                        as well as other components. The next step is a shift to optoelectronic package interconnections. As these transistor and 
                                        interconnections-based electronics begin to come to an end, quantum electronics is expected to takeover. This concept is shown in Figure 1.</p>

                                    <h3 style="margin-left:20px;">A new vision</h3>
                                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">This paper describes a shift from transistor scaling with the most number of transistors in a single large chip [3], 
                                        driven by Mooreâs Law, to the package and system scaling concept that relies on the most number of interconnections (I/Os) between smaller 
                                        chips in the short term, and to quantum computing in the long term. So, while transistor integration to a 20-billion transistor chip on 
                                        individual ICs was the basis of Mooreâs Law for ICs to date, it can be extended by a different vision. In the short term, this vision 
                                        involves new paradigms in electronic and optoelectronic package interconnections in 2D, 2.5D and 3D (Figure 2). Unlike in the past 
                                        with transistor scaling as the primary focus, this new vision is referred to as package and system scalingâits focus is on miniaturization
                                        of active and passive components and interconnecting them to form modules and systems.</p>

                                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">Just like Mooreâs Law has both the doubling of transistors and simultaneous cost reduction from node to node every 
                                        18-24 months, Mooreâs Law for package interconnections can do the same. Interconnections have been driven by computing systems, and within 
                                        computing systems, between logic and memory, consistent with Von Neumannâs architecture. The new era of artificial intelligence mimicking 
                                        the human brain, with several orders better computing performance at lower power than current electronics, is yet another reason for the end of 
                                        Mooreâs Law. The human brain is the ultimate system of interconnections for the highest performance in the smallest size with the lowest power and is 
                                        the new standard in system scaling and interconnections, and in computing performance-power efficiency. This is a lot more than current 3D electronic 
                                        architectures can deliver. A typical human brain has about 90 billion nerve cells interconnected by trillions of synapses, providing trillions of 
                                        pathways for the brain to process the information, along with a petabyte of memory. The electronics today are more like 200,000 interconnections. 
                                        A new Mooreâs Law must, therefore, duplicate this human brain architecture.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">Mooreâs Law for package interconnections has historically evolved, dramatically, from dual-in-line ceramic packages in the
                                         1970s with 16 I/Os, to plastic quad flat packages in the 1980s with 64 I/Os, to ceramic packages in the 1990s with more than 1,000 I/Os, to organic 
                                         laminate built-up packages in excess of 20,000 I/Os, and silicon and embedded packages approaching 200,000 I/Os. Artificial intelligence mimicking 
                                         human brain may need several orders of magnitude [4, 5].</p>
                                    <h3 style="margin-left:20px;">Silicon packaging</h4>
                                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">Currently, silicon packaging is the most leading-edge packaging, as measured by number of I/Os. Therefore, the best Mooreâs
                                         Law for package interconnections currently is with wafer-based silicon packaging, but silicon-based packaging has many limitations at the material, 
                                         device, interconnect, and system levels (Figure 3).</p>

                                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">At the material level, silicon is limited by its ultra-high loss and high dielectric constant (11.4). It is also limited by
                                         small, 300mm wafer sizes, unlike packages and system boards that are manufactured in large panels, typically about 500-1000mm. In addition, silicon
                                          packages need to be ground from 800mm-thick wafers down to 30-100mm thick substrates. Silicon substrates with their coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
                                           of 3PPM/ÂºC , while perfectly matched to ICs, they are totally mismatched to the organic boardâs thermal coefficient of expansion (TCE) around 17PPM/ÂºC. 
                                           This, in turn, requires an additional package in between Si packages and organic boards.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">At the interconnect level, Si packages are typically manufactured with back end of line (BEOL) lithographic materials, 
                                        processes and sub-micron wide, thick structures. These structures tend to be highly resistive and capacitive, thereby contributing to so-called RC 
                                        delays that impact the final bandwidth performance. Almost all the high-performance packages, such as Intelâs EMIB, AMDâs Fiji and Nvidiaâs â are 
                                        manufactured and used for artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and high-performance servers.</p>
                                    <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">Glass packaging: the next best packaging</h4>
                                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Glass packaging is being pioneered and developed by Georgia Tech and its large number of industry partners as the best 
                                        next-generation of packaging with the goal of overcoming the shortcomings of silicon, described above. At the material level, glass is superior to 
                                        silicon in electrical loss, dielectric constant, any TCE between 3 and 9PPM, as well as in production and availability in ultra-thin and ultra-large 
                                        sizes, without having to grind and polish. At the interconnect level, we have developed materials and processes to minimize RC delays with lower 
                                        resistance and lower capacitance redistribution layer (RDL) wiring. At the system level, it can be directly assembled to both Si ICs and organic 
                                        boards, without another layer of packagingâunlike with Si packages. A number of new packaging paradigms developed in the Georgia Tech consortium 
                                        include large-panel processing (in excess of 500mm sizes), development of 1-micron lithography tools, low dielectric constant polymer dielectric 
                                        materials and processes with a high aspect ratio of conductors with lower resistance and a high degree of planarity without chemical mechanical 
                                        polishing (CMP), and barrier metals to improve electro migration of closely spaced conductors. In addition, a new 3D package architecture, 
                                        referred to as 3DGPE, that advances 3D by embedding with ultra-short and low-RC interconnections, helps achieve higher bandwidth than with Si 
                                        interposers.</p>
                                    <h3 style="margin-left:20px;">Optoelectronic packaging</h4>
                                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Photonics has long been viewed as providing higher bandwidth at lower power in smaller and lighter packages than electronics.
                                         It is also immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI). The technology has been used not only for long-distance communications, but also for systems
                                          to systems interconnections.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">As electronics reach bandwidth limits on account of Mooreâs Law limits as described above, optoelectronics becomes a 
                                        necessary solution to achieve bandwidths towards 1Pb/s. Within optoelectronics, there are many ways to improve bandwidth including multiplexing: 
                                        more links per optical channel, wavelength-division multiplexing (i.e., an approach that uses multiple-wavelengths over the same medium), 
                                        as well as modulation methods, such as pulse amplitude modulationâan approach that provides more bits in the same amount of time.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">While there are many ways to fabricate optoelectronics modules, the most desirable technology is one that is made of silicon,
                                         as silicon is the most studied and used in microelectronics. This is referred to as Si photonics, whereby electronic and photonic devices are integrated
                                          onto one single silicon chip using CMOS fabrication techniques. While there are many advantages to this technology, including smaller size
                                           (400nm waveguide width) and mature CMOS manufacturing processes, it also has many challenges that include fiber coupling and the fact that Si doesnât 
                                           lase, requiring alternate on-silicon light sources.</p>
                                    <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">Quantum electronics</h4>
                                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Quantum physics has been a branch of physics for decades with many branches of study within it that include quantum chemistry, 
                                        quantum simulations, quantum machine learning, quantum algorithms, and quantum communications. Quantum computing (QC) has been a topic of research for more
                                         than two decades. As Mooreâs Law-driven electronics begins to slow down in terms of its ability to provide Increased computing at lower power, scientists 
                                         at companies like IBM began to explore quantum devices. Unlike current digital systems that are programmed with bits as data units, either 0 or 1, 
                                         quantum computers use qubits, which can represent a combination of both 0 and 1 at the same time, based on the principle of superposition. This difference 
                                         makes quantum computers exponentially faster than current mainframes and servers.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">In addition, quantum computers can do multiple calculations with multiple inputs simultaneously, unlike todayâs computers that 
                                        can handle only one set of inputs and one calculation at a time. With 50 qubits, for example, the computing power can be 2 to the power of 50. When the 
                                        industry gets to 1000 qubits that becomes 2 to the power of 1000. Currently qubits are at about 50, but even at these low numbers, the computing power 
                                        has been demonstrated well in excess of the best super computers at much lower power. Two factors driving qubits are quality and number. Currently, the 
                                        most visible and dominant companies include IBM, Microsoft, and Google. All the large semiconductor and systems companies are known to have large 
                                        internal programs [6].</p>
                                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Applications for quantum computing are many and include: 1) Rapid R&D for chemicals and pharmaceutical materials with 
                                        simulations; 2) Supercomputing power for autonomous vehicles with quantum AI to reduce fatalities to zero; and 3) Eliminating cybersecurity issues.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Quantum computers are expected to be developed in a Mooreâs lawâlike fashionâevery year from 50 today, to about 5-10,000 by 2030.
                                         Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, IBM, and others have already announced quantum offerings. Initially, quantum computing adoption will be a hybrid
                                          approach, in which parts of the problem would be handled by classical computing, and other parts by quantum AI. Mimicking the human brain may be the
                                           ultimate AI.</p>

                                            Smart Cut&trade; technology makes use of both implantation of light ions and wafer bonding
                                            to define and transfer ultra-thin single-crystal layers from one substrate to another. It
                                            works like an atomic scalpel and allows active layers to be managed independently from
                                            the supporting mechanical substrate. Key benefits include the creation of multiple thin
                                            nanometric scale layers of virtually defect-free silicon by utilizing low temperature bond
                                            and split techniques. These layers are then placed on top of active transistor circuitry.
                                            The thickness of the transferred layer can be determined with a high degree of precision
                                            by adjusting the implantation energy and process engineering. Transistors can then be
                                            completed using etch and deposition processes. Moreover, the donor substrate can be
                                            reused many times as the surface of the silicon wafer is repolished after each layer
                                            transfer operation, and the substrate can be reused.</div>

The FOWLP market can be divided into three segments: high-density round carrier, standard-density round carrier, and large-area panel. With continued price pressure for integrated circuit (IC) package as-sembly, FOWLP is no exception. This drive for a lower cost assembly method has driven the development of large-area panel processing. There are many challenges to panel-level fan-out production.  Many of these challenges are being addressed in consortia activities. But where does the panel fit and what types of packages make sense for large-area panel production? This was one of the topics discussed in the panel session that concluded IWLPC 2018 held in October in San Jose, California.

                                            SEMCO believes the definition of embedded die vs. FOPLP is determined by the use of a RDL. If RDL is used, then it is considered FO. The company started production of embedded passives and activities in 2010. For example, Galaxy Watch uses FO with the panel process. The application processor is placed next to the PMIC, which is in the bottom package, using SEMCOâs FOPLP process. Backside RDL on package thereby enabling SEMCO to stack a standard memory, creating a package-on-package (PoP). In this example, RDL is used instead of packages such as molded core embedded package (MCeP) and sub-strate-like PCB (SLP). Intel started embedding capacitors and inductors a long time ago and noted that the use of RDL is what allows the package technology to be called FO. The difference is the L/S requirement: an L/S >15/15 could be considered embedded die, while a finer pitch of &lt;15/15 would be described as FO.

                                            The panel also responded to the question regarding major applications for panel FO (FO in general). Deca believes there are three classes of FO applications: 1) Single-die package, which is happening today: e.g., Infineonâs eWLB is an early example still in volume production; 2) Multi-die system-in-package (SiP), and there are several such multi-die products. 3) Heterogeneous integration, greatest of all, has to use sub-1Âµm features. SEMCO noted that future 2020 DDR5 and GDDR6 power integrity and signal integrity will be driving new packages. Mean-while, the memory package will need to deal with more power. Future applica-tions include application processor plus memory.

                                            According to AT&S, the RF market is a good candidate for panel FO, as well as multi-die packages and large body sizes. ASE noted that its first products with its  M-Series FOWLP on a 300mm line will be PMIC and Audio CODEC, followed by RF. ASE has 300mm FOCoS for 2Âµm feature RDL. The next versions of FOCoS will be for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and logic.

                                            For its part, Intel noted that it builds and sells final product. With larger products, they lose more space around the edge of the dieâsuch as when large product is within a SiP. It makes sense to integrate a big chip into a larger size panel.
                                        </p>
                                   
                                        <p>
                                            The panel did not agree on an optimal panel size. Intel favors 510 x 515mm, others say 600mm x 600mm. ASE and Deca prefer 600mm x 600mm, but they did note that there is no reason to go to a panel option until 2020 when there is suffi-cient demand. It was noted that it is possible to cut the panel in four quarters and use 300mm tools. Meanwhile, SEMCO is looking at artificial intelligence (AI), servers, edge computing, etc., for panel applications. Edge computing may need large packages around >30mm, 50mm, or even 75mm.

                                            The panel members agreed that yield is critical and that panel processes must have the same process yields as the round FOWLP process (i.e., 99.5% and above). One issue mentioned by ASE is that many panel tools are for PCB oper-ations and designed for operation in a Class 10,000 clean room. The FO process on panel requires class 100 designed equipment. Handling is a concern because panels cannot be handled manually. SEMCO is in mass production with high yield.
