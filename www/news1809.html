                                This premier international conference, sponsored by the IEEE Electronics Packaging Society (IEEE EPS), covers a wide spectrum of electronic packaging technology topics, including components, materials, assembly, interconnect design, device and system packaging, wafer level packaging, Si photonics, LED and IoT, optoelectronics, 2.5D and 3D integration technology, and reliability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ECTC Program Committee, with more than 200 experts from broad-ranging technical areas, is committed to creating an engaging technical program for all. ECTC typically attracts more than 1,400 attendees from over 25 countries. Last year’s 68th ECTC in San Diego, California, had 1,738 attendees, with 331 papers and interactive presentations featured in 41 sessions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The 69th ECTC program will include six parallel technical sessions in the mornings and afternoons over three days, along with other special topic panel discussions to present high-level trends and best practices in the industry. Professional Development Courses (PDCs) will also be offered by world-class experts, enabling participants to broaden their technical knowledge base.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The technical program and PDCs will be supplemented by Technology Corner Exhibits, which provide an opportunity for leading companies in the electronic components, materials, and packaging fields to exhibit their latest technologies and products. Last year’s 68th ECTC matched our record number of 106 exhibitors.
                            </p>
                            <P>
