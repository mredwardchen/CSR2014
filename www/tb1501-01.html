                            <div class="col-md-9">  <p style="text-indent:15px;">Industry experts will tackle the topics of fluxes and ball grid array (BGA) head-in-pillow defects during technical sessions at IPC APEX EXPO 2015 (2/22-2/26/15; San Diego, CA). Alpha’s Jason Fullerton, Customer Technical Support Engineer for the Americas Region, will moderate two of these sessions. The “Fluxes I” session focuses on the makeup and performance of the flux component of solder paste. The BGA “Head in Pillow” session discusses the defects of the same name on BGA packages.

                                <p style="text-indent:15px;">Fullerton told <i>Chip Scale Review </i>that in the sessions he is moderating there will be multiple examples of new research that will be presented including: 1) A study of how solder paste storage conditions can affect surface insulation resistance (SIR) performance; 2) A case study of a method of designing solder paste stencils to eliminate head-in-pillow defects caused by component warpage; and 3) An experiment to quantify the effect of component contamination with NaCl and its impact on the incidence of head-in-pillow defects. <p>

                            <p style="text-indent:15px;">“The head-in-pillow defect is an excellent example of an area where the industry is still trying to fully understand the condition and all the influences on its formation,” Fullerton told <i>CSR</i>. While the company does formulation and performance testing to ensure its solder paste products are as robust as possible to this defect type, he explained that there are conditions that lead to head-in-pillow defects that solder paste cannot be expected to completely eliminate. One such cause is component warpage. “Some solder pastes are more robust to this condition than others. But there are cases where assemblers don't have the freedom to change products and have to adapt to the performance provided by the paste in use.” He noted that one paper to be presented in the “Head-in-Pillow” session describes a means to optimize the amount of solder paste used by varying the design of the stencils used in the process to eliminate the occurrence of head-in-pillow defects when the warpage of a component is known and consistent. “The work presented demonstrates a deeper understanding of all of the mechanisms involved in the formation of this type of defect than is commonly seen in the industry.”
                            </p>      <p style="text-indent:15px;">
                            Component contamination is another condition that can cause head-in-pillow defects, commented Fullerton. “Although many assemblers may initially suspect that the cause is some sort of performance deficiency in the solder paste used, one paper in the “Head-in-Pillow” session shows the results of an experiment designed to demonstrate the correlation between contamination and incidence of head-in-pillow defects.” Fullerton further added that providing the data to show that contamination can be a significant factor in forming these defects is important to the industry because it provides additional avenues of investigation to be pursued when trying to troubleshoot their cause.
                        </p>      <p style="text-indent:15px;">
                            Fullerton believes that there is a great deal of value in these kind of technical sessions if one can transfer what is learned to the production floor. As an example, he offered up
                            one paper in the “Fluxes” session that describes a number of tests that can be used to evaluate the performance of solder paste. “When users set out to test solder pastes, there are a variety of potential test methods that can be included in their overall test plan,” said Fullerton. “Many solder paste manufacturers, Alpha included, can provide technical resources to assist in defining an appropriate test plan for evaluation of current and candidate solder pastes.” That said, he noted that some users prefer to perform their testing without involving the material suppliers, while others desire simple tests that can be repeated periodically to ensure the performance of their chosen solder paste is consistent over time. “In these situations, this paper is an excellent resource for practical tests that can be performed on the factory floor with equipment that is typically available to the manufacturing engineer.”

                        </p>      <p style="text-indent:15px;">
                            Looking ahead, Fullerton sees the industry's major challenge as the continuing reduction of package form factors and the impact on the interconnect materials and processes used to assemble ultra fine-pitch components to PCBAs. “For example, the evolution of passive component packages from 0201 to 01005 to even smaller packages is pushing the limits of solder paste materials and deposition methods,” said Fullerton. “Solder paste manufacturers are now manufacturing and providing solder paste particle distributions that didn't exist when I started my career, and developing no-clean flux materials that are capable of performing at the ultra-small circuit spacing typical of modern electronics.” He also observed that solder paste stencil printing has enjoyed decades as the primary application method, but that method is now challenged by the viability of jetting technology. “Given the current trends in hand-held electronics and the continuing demand for more performance in these small form factors, I expect the assembly challenges due to miniaturization of electronics to be an important consideration for the foreseeable future.”
