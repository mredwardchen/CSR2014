                           <p>Tokyo, Japan and St. Petersburg, FL - May 31, 2016 — DISCO Corporation, the world's largest dicing equipment provider, has signed a global distribution agreement with Plasma-Therm for its plasma dicing technology, the companies announced on May 31, 2016
                           </p><p>
                               The quality and cost-saving benefits of plasma dicing will now be available to semiconductor manufacturing customers worldwide through DISCO Corp.'s global sales and service network.
                        </p><p>
                               DISCO executive Noboru Yoshinaga said, “DISCO is keenly aware that plasma dicing is a key enabling technology for advanced packaging, and now we can provide complete Kiru, Kezuru, Migaku (dicing, grinding, polishing) solutions to customers. After a careful evaluation, DISCO determined that Plasma-Therm's technology is the solution of choice, due to its cost of ownership and performance,” he said.
                        </p><p>
                               DISCO will install a 300 mm Singulator® system in its Tokyo facility this year to support customer demonstrations and semiconductor device packaging evaluations.
                        </p><p>
                               Abdul Lateef, Plasma-Therm CEO, said, “We are extremely pleased to be partnering with DISCO, the recognized leader in back-end processing. The industry needs the enabling technology of plasma dicing to overcome today's semiconductor advanced packaging challenges — small and sensitive devices and thin wafers.”
                        </p><p>
                               Plasma-Therm has been granted multiple patents for its inventions related to equipment and applications for plasma dicing on tape. Plasma-Therm shipped its first Singulator® plasma dicing system in early 2013. Customers in Europe, Asia, and the United States have been using Singulator® systems in production since then, and have reported up to 30 percent higher die yield per wafer.
