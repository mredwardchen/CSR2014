                                <p>Prof. Rao Tummala is a Distinguished and Endowed Chair Professor at Georgia Tech in the USA. He is well known as an industrial technologist, technology pioneer, and educator. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, he was an IBM Fellow and Director of Advanced Systems Packaging, pioneering such major technologies as the industry’s first plasma display in the 1970s and the first and next two generations of 100-chip MCM package integration in the 1980s for servers, mainframes and supercomputers. He is the father of LTCC and the system-on-package (SoP) technologies. As an educator, Prof. Tummala was instrumental in setting up the largest Academic Center funded by NSF as its 1st NSF Engineering Research Center in Electronic Systems at Georgia Tech, pioneering an integrated approach to research, education and industry collaborations with companies in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China. The Center, referred to as PRC, produced and supplied more than 1200 PhD and MS packaging engineers to the electronic industry. He has published about 800 technical papers and invented technologies that resulted in over 110 patents and inventions. He wrote the first modern handbook in packaging, Microelectronics Packaging Handbook (1988); then the first undergrad textbook, Fundamentals of Microsystem Packaging (2001); and the first book introducing the concept of SoP, Introduction to System-on-Package (2006). He received more than 50 industry, academic and professional society awards. He is a member of NAE and an IEEE Fellow, as well as President of the IEEE CPMT and IMAPS Societies. </p>
