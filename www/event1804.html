                            </p>

                            <p>Todayâ€™s cars have significant electronic content that slowly transforms the way we are driving. The main focus of the automotive industry has been on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving to improve the overall driving experience and make driving safer. Thermal performance and reliability becomes very critical for these high-power, intelligent electronics, often including sensors and heterogeneous packaging systems. These systems need to last more than 10 years under often hostile environments. In this talk, Karthik will discuss some of the needs in the industry and how multi-physics solutions might be able to address requirements such as thermal, thermal-aware EM, and thermal-induced stress analysis of an advanced Chip-Package-System used in ADAS electronics.
