                            <h4>IMAPS 2014 Explores the Future of Packaging </h4><p>[Chip Scale Review staff] </p>The 47th annual IMAPS 2014 International Symposium on Microelectronics convened at the Town and Country Resort and Convention Center in San Diego, CA on October 13 - 16, 2014. The theme of the event this year was "Future of Packaging." Dr. Subramanian S. Iyer, IBM Fellow and IMAPS 2014 Technical Chair, commented, "With classical silicon scaling saturating, and the cost per transistor, in some estimates potentially increasing, keeping the expectations of Moore's 'law' going for another decade or two will depend on how we successfully scale packages and boards."

                                The ability to package ICs at the wafer-level has been a major contributor to size and cost reduction over the last 10 years. Significant technical challenges had to be overcome to realize these advantages in a production environment. The wafer-level packaging of MEMS and Microsystems also has contributed to the size and cost reduction of those devices, but with greater technical challenges and with a greater reward for overcoming those challenges. This course will review the general requirements for packaging of a variety of MEMS and Microsystem devices and will present methods to meeting those requirements with wafer-level packaging technologies. While research efforts and scientific principles will be at the heart of the discussion, the focus will be on practical implementation of the wafer-level package technology. Case studies will be used to illustrate major concepts. Wafer-level packaged devices covered in the course will include physical sensors such as pressure and inertial sensors, optical sensors and cameras, switches and RF devices as well as fluidic and biomedical devices.

                            <p><strong>T2 - Wafer Level-Chip Scale Packaging (WL-CSP)        </strong>   <br>
                                Wafer Level-Chip Scale Packaging (WL-CSP) has gained much success as a packaging form factor in the consumer arena in the past few years that it is almost considered as a "technology commodity." It has been driven by needs for cost reduction, size shrinkage, and enhanced performance. This course will provide an overview of the WL-CSP technology. The market drivers, benefits, and challenges facing industry-wide adoption will be discussed. The standard configurations will be reviewed in terms of their construction, manufacturing process, and published electrical and thermal performance, together with package and board level reliability.

                            <p><strong>T3 - 3D IC Integration and Packaging         </strong>          <br>
                                3D IC packaging and 3D IC integration are different. In general, the TSV (through-silicon via) separates 3D IC packaging from 3D IC integration because the latter use TSVs, but 3D IC packaging does not. TSV is the heart of 3D IC integration. It provides the opportunity for the shortest chip-to-chip, and the smallest pad size and pitch of interconnects. The potential high volume manufacturing of 3D IC integration is: (1) memory-chip stacking, (2) wide I/O memory (or logic-on-logic), (3) wide I/O DRAM, wide I/O 2, HMC, and HBM, and (4) wide I/O interface (or 2.5D IC integration). In this presentation, the supply chains and the critical steps such as FEOL, MOL, BEOL, TSV, MEOL (middle-end-of-line), assembly, and test and their ownerships for high-volume manufacturing for those four groups of 3D IC integration will be discussed. The 3D IC packaging, which has been keeping 3D IC integration away from volume production, will be briefly mentioned first. Key enabling technologies such as TSV forming and filling,           front and backside metallization, RDL, temporary bonding and de-bonding, and microbumping, assembly and reliability will be presented and discussed. All the materials are based on the papers and books published by the lecturer and others in the past three years.

                            <p><strong>T4 - Achieving High Reliability for Lead-Free Solder Joints - Materials Consideration     </strong>   <br>
                                This course covers the detailed material considerations required for achieving high reliability for lead-free solder joints. The reliability discussed includes joint mechanical properties, development of type and extent of intermetallic compounds (IMC) under a variety of material combinations and aging conditions and how those IMCs affect the reliability. The failure modes, thermal cycling reliability, and fragility of solder joints as a function of material combination, thermal history, and stress history will be addressed in details, and novel alloys with reduced fragility will be presented. Electromigration and tin whisker will also be discussed. The emphasis of this course is placed on the understanding of how the various factors contributing to the failure modes, and how to select proper solder alloys and surface finishes for achieving high reliability. Also will be presented are the desirable future alloys and fluxes in order to meet the challenge of miniaturization.

                            <h4>TI demonstrates leadership in copper wire bonding technology
                                with more than 22B units shipped</h4>

                            <p><strong>Extends copper wire production into high reliability applications including
                                automotive and industrial</strong></p>

                            <p>Dallas,TX - October 14, 2014 - Texas Instruments (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today announced it
                                has shipped more than 22 billion units of copper wire bonding technology from its
                                internal assembly sites and is now in production for major high reliability applications
                                including automotive and industrial. The majority of TI's existing analog and CMOS
                                silicon technology nodes have been qualified with copper, and all new TI technologies
                                and packages are being developed with copper wire bond. Along with its quality,
                                reliability and cost benefits, copper wire offers equal or better manufacturability
                                compared to gold. It also delivers 40 percent higher electrical conductivity to give
                                customers a boost in overall product performance with a number of TI's analog and
                                embedded processing parts.
                            </p>

                            <p>"TI has pioneered development of copper wire bonding for high volume production across a
                                broad portfolio of products, factories and technologies," said Jan Vardaman, president
                                and founder of TechSearch International, Inc. "TI was one of the first manufacturers to
                                recognize the many advantages copper wire technology offers a customer. For example, it
                                provides more thermal stability than gold and has superior mechanical properties to
                                increase bond strength."
                            </p>

                            <p>TI is currently shipping about two billion units of copper wire bond technology each
                                quarter. This includes production for key automotive segments such as safety (e.g.,
                                anti-lock brake systems, power steering, stability control), infotainment, body and
                                comfort, and powertrain. Enabling copper wire bond technology for automotive
                                applications requires significant development to automotive standards and strict
                                manufacturing discipline. TI's extensive manufacturability and reliability testing meets
                                automotive industry qualification requirements and includes thorough process corner
                                development, production quality and reliability monitoring, and manufacturing controls.
                            </p>

                            <p>TI began shipping copper wire in its products in 2008. Today, all of TI's assembly and
                                test (A/T) sites are running copper wire bonding on all TI package types, including BGA,
                                QFN, QFP, TSSOP, SOIC, PDIP and others. Copper is at 71 percent of TI's total wire usage and
                                TI is in production with:
                            <p> * Minimum 30/60 microns staggered bond pad pitch <br>
                                * Up to 1000 wires in BGA packages <br>
                                * Multi-chip stacked die with die to die wire bonding <br>
                                * Minimum 0.8mil copper wire diameter <br></p>

                            <p> "Having multiple wire bond capabilities that support a wide range of silicon
                                technologies and product applications is a great benefit to our customers," said Devan
                                Iyer, director of Semiconductor Packaging in TI's Technology & Manufacturing Group.
                                "TI's flexible manufacturing strategy also improves customer delivery and performance
                                for products using copper wire bond. We have a clear capacity advantage, both internally
                                and with qualified subcontractors, that enable us to meet all levels of customer
                                demand."

                                        (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP) with silicon substrates, can lead to enhanced
                                        device performance due to higher carrier mobility as well as open up new
                                        capabilities such as the emission of light through silicon, which can enable optical
                                        interconnects and routers. However, combining these materials through traditional
                                        epitaxial growth processes leads to crystal dislocation defects due to differences
                                        in lattice constant and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), which in turn
                                        degrade performance.

                                    <p><strong>Benefits of Wafer Bonding </strong>
                                    <p>These manufacturing issues can be mitigated by growing each semiconductor material
                                        separately on optimized growth substrates and then combining them through wafer
                                        bonding. Room-temperature covalent bonding, in particular, is an ideal choice since
                                        it eliminates the need for annealing processes, which generate high temperatures
                                        that can add additional stress due to CTE mismatch. However, a key limitation of
                                        room-temperature covalent bonding has been the inability to maintain tight control
                                        of the thickness and uniformity of the bond interface layer, including effective
                                        removal of particle contaminants and the native oxide layers, which is necessary in
                                        order to achieve an interface that has both sufficient bond strength and electrical
                                        conductivity between the bonded materials. The EVG580 ComBond addresses these
                                        limitations.
