                                    The Company has retained appropriate consultants to assist in the evaluation and selection of a new site
                                    for the China Plant. To ensure minimal disruption to its China operations, the Company anticipates that
                                    any new site selected for the China Plant will be located in proximity to the current location of the China
                                    Plant and that the relocation of the China Plant to its new site will only take place in late 2017.
