            <p>The SMTA and Chip Scale Review are pleased to announce plans for the 12th Annual International Wafer-Level Packaging Conference and Tabletop Exhibition. This premier industry event explores leading-edge design, material, and process technologies being applied to Wafer-Level Packaging applications. There will be special emphasis on the numerous device and end product applications (RF/wireless, sensors, mixed technology, optoelectronics) that demand wafer level packaging solutions for integration, cost, and performance requirements.
            </p>    <p>
            The IWLPC Technical Committee would like to invite you to submit an abstract for this program.  <b>Abstract deadline is April 17th, 2015. </b>

            </p>

            <p>
                   The conference includes three tracks with two days of technical paper presentations covering: Wafer Level Packaging; 3-D (Stacked) Packaging; and MEMS Packaging. Also we will offer professional development courses.
                    </p>
