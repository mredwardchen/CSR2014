                            </h4>
                       
                           
                            <p>
                                <b>Poway, CA., & Norwood, MA - May 8, 2018 - </b>Cohu, Inc. (NASDAQ:COHU) and Xcerra Corporation (NASDAQ:XCRA) announced they have entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Cohu will acquire Xcerra for a combination of cash and stock. The acquisition is expected to make Cohu a global leader in semiconductor test, with combined sales for Cohu and Xcerra in excess of $800 million for the last twelve months.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Upon the closing of the transaction, Xcerra shareholders will be entitled to receive $9.00 in cash and 0.2109 of a share of Cohu common stock, subject to the terms of the definitive agreement. Based on the closing price of Cohu common stock as of May 7, 2018, the transaction values Xcerra at $13.92 per share, or approximately $796 million in equity value, with a total enterprise value of approximately $627 million, after excluding Xcerra’s cash and marketable securities net of the debt on its balance sheet as of January 31, 2018. The transaction value represents a premium of 8.4% to Xcerra's closing price on May 7, 2018, and a premium of 15.4% to Xcerra's 30-day average closing price. 

                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                "This proposed acquisition is a powerful combination of two complementary companies that will accelerate our strategy to diversify our product offerings and strengthen Cohu’s position as a global leader in back-end semiconductor equipment. The depth and breadth of the combined product portfolios, engineering and product development resources, as well as the global customer support platforms will enable us to deliver comprehensive semiconductor back-end solutions that better meet the future needs of our customers,” commented Luis Müller, Cohu's President and CEO. “The acquisition of Xcerra increases our addressable market to approximately $5 billion across handlers, contactors, test and inspection, further strengthening our ability to fully capitalize on the secular growth opportunities in the automotive, IoT, industrial and mobility markets. We are excited to welcome the Xcerra team to Cohu and look forward to an efficient completion of the transaction, with a focus on delivering long-term value to our customers, employees and shareholders." 

                            </p>

                           

                            <p>
                                The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share and generate over $20 million of annual run-rate cost synergies within 2 years of closing, excluding stock-based compensation and other charges. Cohu intends to fund the cash payable to Xcerra shareholders with a combination of cash on hand from the combined companies’ balance sheets, and approximately $350 million in debt financing. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2018, subject to approval by both companies’ respective shareholders, antitrust regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Xcerra shareholders are expected to own approximately 30% of the combined company upon the closing of the transaction. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies. Luis Müller will remain president and chief executive officer and lead the combined company, and Jeff Jones will continue to serve as vice president of finance and chief financial officer. Two members of Xcerra's board of directors will join Cohu's board upon the closing of the transaction.

                                <b>Singapore and Hong Kong, April 3rd, 2018 - </b>ASM Pacific Technology Ltd. (ASMPT) announced that it has signed a definitive agreement with Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL) to acquire TEL NEXX, Inc. (NEXX). The deal is expected to close when approvals from the authorities have been received. The acquisition is another major step by the Group in pursuing its growth strategy of tapping into new high-growth markets and expanding their product offerings to the semiconductor advanced packaging market.
