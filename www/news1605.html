                                Piscataway, NJ – May 24, 2016 – The IEEE Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology Society (CPMT) will recognize its 2016 award winners at the 66th Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC), 2 June 2016, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. With these awards, the Society honors distinguished performance in technical fields and dedication to the Society and profession.

                        </p><p>
                                A world leader in electronics packaging reliability, Michael Pecht, IEEE Fellow, has developed prediction tools that enable manufacturers to make their products safer and more operationally available. As an alternative to flawed handbook-based reliability prediction methods, Pecht developed the physics-of-failure (PoF) approach to electronics reliability. The PoF approach provides
                            greater accuracy by taking into account the actual failure mechanisms of the device in the operating conditions that the device would likely face in the field. He also developed prognostics-based health assessment methods that have been adopted by industry to predict reliability for critical systems such as vehicle batteries, avionics, and alternative energy sources. Pecht also founded the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering.

                            <p><b>Proven 2.5D and 3D Semiconductor Integration Technologies to be incorporated in Next Generation National Laboratory Research </b> </p>
                            <p>
                            San Jose, CA - April 18th, 2016 – Invensas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tessera Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSRA), announced today that Sandia National Laboratories signed a new license agreement for ZiBond® and Direct Bond Interconnect (DBI®) technologies. With this license Sandia will have access to the most advanced 3D integration technologies available, for use in a wide range of semiconductor applications.

                            </p>  <p>
                            For more than 60 years, Sandia National Laboratories has been the premier science and engineering laboratory in the United States for national security and innovation. Working closely with U.S. government agencies, private industry and academic institutions, Sandia has led the charge to research, develop and deliver essential technologies used to solve many of the nation’s most important security, climate change and sustainable energy challenges.
                            </p>  <p>
                            “The demand for cost-effective, versatile, 2.5D and 3D integration technologies has risen significantly, as research and commercial enterprises seek to expand overall performance and functionality of electronics products,” said Craig Mitchell, President Invensas Corporation. “ZiBond and DBI technologies are currently deployed in leading edge semiconductor products, and we are pleased to now make them available to Sandia, a premier government research institution.”
                             </p>  <p>
                            ZiBond is a low-temperature homogeneous bonding technology, that enables room temperature die or wafer-level 3D integration, without the need for the application of external pressure. DBI is a low temperature, hybrid bonding technology with integrated electrical interconnects, that offers the industry’s finest pitch and lowest cost-of-ownership 3D interconnect platform.
                             </p>  <p>
                            Both ZiBond and DBI deliver the fastest bonding throughput currently available in the industry, resulting in up to a 15x increase in wafer bonding throughput. Both technologies offer the thinnest available 2.5D and 3D semiconductor assemblies, while reducing wafer warpage, increasing reliability and improving thermal performance. Additionally, low processing temperatures significantly reduce equipment and process cost for high volume manufacturing.
                            </p>  <p>
