                            <p><b>Proven 2.5D and 3D Semiconductor Integration Technologies to be incorporated in Next Generation National Laboratory Research </b> </p>
                            <p>
                            San Jose, CA - April 18th, 2016 – Invensas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tessera Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSRA), announced today that Sandia National Laboratories signed a new license agreement for ZiBond® and Direct Bond Interconnect (DBI®) technologies. With this license Sandia will have access to the most advanced 3D integration technologies available, for use in a wide range of semiconductor applications.

                            </p>  <p>
                            For more than 60 years, Sandia National Laboratories has been the premier science and engineering laboratory in the United States for national security and innovation. Working closely with U.S. government agencies, private industry and academic institutions, Sandia has led the charge to research, develop and deliver essential technologies used to solve many of the nation’s most important security, climate change and sustainable energy challenges.
                            </p>  <p>
                            “The demand for cost-effective, versatile, 2.5D and 3D integration technologies has risen significantly, as research and commercial enterprises seek to expand overall performance and functionality of electronics products,” said Craig Mitchell, President Invensas Corporation. “ZiBond and DBI technologies are currently deployed in leading edge semiconductor products, and we are pleased to now make them available to Sandia, a premier government research institution.”
                             </p>  <p>
                            ZiBond is a low-temperature homogeneous bonding technology, that enables room temperature die or wafer-level 3D integration, without the need for the application of external pressure. DBI is a low temperature, hybrid bonding technology with integrated electrical interconnects, that offers the industry’s finest pitch and lowest cost-of-ownership 3D interconnect platform.
                             </p>  <p>
                            Both ZiBond and DBI deliver the fastest bonding throughput currently available in the industry, resulting in up to a 15x increase in wafer bonding throughput. Both technologies offer the thinnest available 2.5D and 3D semiconductor assemblies, while reducing wafer warpage, increasing reliability and improving thermal performance. Additionally, low processing temperatures significantly reduce equipment and process cost for high volume manufacturing.
                            </p>  <p>
