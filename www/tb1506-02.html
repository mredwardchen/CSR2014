                            Evans Analytical Group (EAG) recently enhanced its capabilities with the acquisition of multiple advanced imaging and inspection tools for electronics failure analysis. In particular, the company acquired an OKOS VUE 400-P scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) and ultrasonic non-destructive package testing tool that provides advanced imaging capabilities in conjunction with other visual examination methods. According to the company, the tool uses ultrasound waves to detect changes in materials’ acoustic impedances that, when investigating a package failure, would reveal voids, delamination, or underfill problems. The tool has multiple transducer options to support numerous package types and can acquire multiple gates simultaneously for single-scan capture of die surface, die attach, and transmission mode (also known as thru-scan) images.

                            Aram Sarkissian, General Manager, Microelectronics Test and Engineering (MTE) for EAG, told <i>Chip Scale Review</i>, that failure analysis and debug has gotten inordinately more complex as a result of both process technology and package technology advancements. Especially for devices used in mobile applications, “Every single IC design has its own package,” said Sarkissian. “There’s a proliferation of new package types, a lot of custom packages, as well as new materials, and small-scale form factors to consider.” The company took these trends into account when making its latest tool acquisitions.

                            <i>CSR</i> asked Sarkissian to comment on the impact that increasing industry consolidation and complexity of new packages has had on the failure analysis process. With complexity at every single step in the process (i.e., manufacturing flow, packaging flow, test flow, etc.), Sarkissian told <i>CSR</i> that there is more collaboration with customers. “The analysis is also more complex, for example, there are more intermittent failures and failure modes that happen over time because of stress and are dependent on varying operating conditions,” said Sarkissian. “You have to be more careful with design of experiments and be savvy about how to use the [failure analysis] tools.” Still another observation he made was that the universe of people that can solve these more complicated failure analysis problems is shrinking. In the past, companies were vertically integrated, with expertise in house. “Then, with the proliferation of fabless companies, there were many small companies that were design focused and hardly touched silicon, and they used outside labs. But very few outside labs have been able to keep up in terms of failure analysis expertise to be able to address the challenges that companies have today with the more complex devices and types of failures.”
