                                EV Group (EVG) recently introduced two new configurations to its EVG®580 ComBond® series of automated high-vacuum covalent wafer bonding systems. The additions address the needs of universities and R&D institutes, as well as high-volume manufacturing (HVM) requirements. Both configurations achieve electrically conductive and oxide-free bonds of materials with different lattice constants and coefficients of thermal expansion at room temperature. Applications that require room-temperature bonding of substrates with very different material properties and that are supported by the product family include advanced engineered substrates, power devices, stacked solar cells, and emerging technologies such as silicon photonics.
                               </p><p style="text-indent:15px;">
                            Further highlighting the significance of the above-named applications, the company explained that combining materials with different properties to produce electronic devices can lead to enhanced device performance as a result of higher carrier mobility and even lead to new capabilities such as the emission of light through silicon (e.g., optical interconnects and routers). However, Thomas Uhrmann, Director of Business Development at EVG, told <i>Chip Scale Review </i>that combining such materials through traditional epitaxial growth processes leads to crystal dislocation defects caused by differences in lattice constants and coefficients of thermal expansion that result in degraded performance. “These issues can be mitigated by growing each semiconductor material separately on optimized growth substrates and then combining them through wafer bonding,” said Uhrmann. “Room-temperature covalent bonding is an ideal choice since it eliminates the need for annealing processes, which generate high temperatures that add additional stress due to CTE mismatch.”  </p> <p style="text-indent:15px;">
                        </p><p style="text-indent:15px;">
                            Uhrmann also pointed out that room-temperature covalent bonding has a limitation because of its inability to maintain tight control of the thickness and uniformity of the bond interface layer, including effective removal of particle contaminants and the native oxide layers. These are necessary in order to achieve an interface that has both sufficient bond strength and electrical conductivity between the bonded materials. “To achieve conductive (i.e., oxide-free) bond interfaces with high bond strength, the native oxide layers have to be removed while maintaining the low surface roughness of the substrates and while avoiding any contamination induced by the process,” Uhrmann told <i>CSR</i>. “Standard ion bombardment processes induce defects and dislocations in the crystal structures, which leads to amorphous layers and increases the surface roughness of the substrate. This process also produces metal ion contamination.”
                        </p><p style="text-indent:15px;">
                            Because the new product series is based on a dry etch process that directs energized particles onto a surface, Uhrmann explained that the ComBond activation module (CAM) offers tight control of several key process parameters, including particle energy, gas composition (which influences the oxide-removal rate) and process uniformity. “As a result, amorphous layer thickness and surface roughness can be minimized,” said Uhrmann. By its very design, particularly the materials that were selected, the CAM module prevents process-induced metal contamination. “The CAM module itself is a closed chamber with separated vacuum control and the process is a single-wafer process, which prevents cross-contamination of the treated wafers. By enabling oxide-free and particle-free surfaces, a room-temperature or low-temperature (i.e., less than 400° C) bonding process can be applied to avoid amorphous layer growth and achieve high conductivity of the interface.”
                        </p><p style="text-indent:15px;">
                            Because many of the target applications for the new product series are new or emerging fields, including silicon photonics, much of the work involved in heterogeneous materials integration is taking place today at the R&D level at universities and research institutes, Uhrmann told <i>CSR</i>. “As a result, we are offering an entry-level tool configuration that supports R&D research in these areas,” said Uhrmann. “The entry-level tool configuration has the same CAM module design inherent in the standard and HVM configurations, but comes with one cassette station or manual load port, as well as a single-arm robot to support up to three process modules, which is sufficient for research needs.”

                        </p><p style="text-indent:15px;">
                            The HVM configuration features several enhancements over the standard configuration. According to the company, these include: 1) The ability to configure with two cassette stations or an equipment front-end module with up to four cassettes for continuous mode operation; and 2) A dual-arm robot to support up to six process modules compared to five process modules with the standard configuration. “This can equate to up to a 50% increase in throughput,” said Uhrmann.
