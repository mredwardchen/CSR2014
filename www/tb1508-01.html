                                  Imec and SPTS Technologies recently announced that they are jointly developing a highly accurate, short cycle-time dry silicon removal and low-temperature passivation solution for through-silicon via-middle processing and thinning of the top wafer in wafer-to-wafer bonding. The collaboration is addressing the need for an industrially viable 3D-IC technology, i,.e., one in which the via reveal process has a shorter cycle-time etching process. One of the challenges noted by imec is related to accumulating non-uniformities coming from the TSV frontside etching, bonding and grinding processes; variations of a few microns may occur in residual silicon thickness above the via tips.
                              </p><p style="text-indent:15px;">
                                  The companies noted that a highly selective process to thin TSV liners and smooth post-etch surfaces is essential to achieve the necessary precision and control within-wafer uniformity. <i>Chip Scale Review</i> asked Eric Beyne, Fellow and Program Director for 3D System Integration at imec, about the technical challenges that need to be overcome to develop the highly selective process. “For all TSV processes, highly conformal and thin TSV dielectric liners are preferred,” Beyne told <i>CSR</i>. He further noted that for high aspect ratio TSVs, different types of PECVD and PEALD liners are available today that give the required within-wafer uniformity. “The PECVD dielectric layers focus on the low-temperature backside passivation layers that are deposited on the wafer backside after wafer thinning and TSV reveal, but before Cu exposure. This prevents any risks for Cu backside contamination and these specific PECVD dielectric layers feature low residual electrical charges while being deposited at low temperatures.”
                              </p><p style="text-indent:15px;">
                                  The dry etching solution the collaborators are developing features in situ end point detection, which enables controlled and very precise processing. According to the collaborators, the process achieves the required TSV height while avoiding lengthy and multiple rework steps, thereby minimizing the overall cost per wafer. The first results they reported demonstrate that 1.57µm nail height can be controlled within a 300nm range (<b>Figure 1</b>). Beyne told <i>CSR</i> that the use of end point detection for detecting the position of via-middle TSVs during backside plasma thinning has been demonstrated and that further work will focus on fine tuning the plasma etch process to also compensate with the backgrinding Si-thickness center-to-edge nonuniformity (TTV) and possible center-to-edge nonuniformity of the TSV depth. “This will allow for even tighter control of the via-middle TSV-reveal process,” said Beyne. “The use of a different end point detection system for final Si thickness has also been demonstrated and it allows for extreme thinning of Si wafers to a 5µm remaining bulk thickness.” Further work will focus on fine tuning the plasma etch process to also compensate with the backgrinding Si-thickness center-to-edge nonuniformity (TTV). “This will allow for even thinner final Si-thicknesses.”
                              </p><p style="text-indent:15px;">
                                  To follow the via reveal etch step, imec and SPTS will also work on PECVD dielectric passivation stacks, with SiO and SiN layers deposited at temperatures below 200°C.  The collaboration will use SPTS’s Versalis fxP system, a single-wafer cluster platform carrying both etch and dielectric deposition modules to be installed into imec’s 300mm packaging line in Q32015.
