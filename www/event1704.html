                              <p>
 
                                Much has changed over the last 15 years in the electronics industry, one of the most significant being the incredible growth of MEMS enabled sensors.  The use of sensors in mobility applications has increased by more than 1000-fold over the last decade alone.  MEPTEC’s 15th Annual MEMS and Sensors symposium is evolving as well, explicitly acknowledging sensors and how their integration in mobility, wearables, health care, automotive and healthcare devices continue to change the way we live, move, and communicate.  As these rapid transitions continue, what do the industry leaders see as new applications that will continue to drive these trends?  What use cases require us to develop innovative solutions to enable highly reliable and cost effective products?  At what point do we need alternative and out of the box solutions to keep up with the projected demand in tens of billions of units?  Will serial manufacturing and test solutions of today scale to meet these requirements or do we need new additive manufacturing solutions to keep pace?

                                The Burn-in and Test Strategies (BiTS) Workshop held its 18th annual North American event March 5-8 in Mesa, AZ. The event was attended by more than 240 test engineers and managers from around the world, representing more than 100 companies including top foundries, fabless, and integrated device manufacturers and outsourced subassembly and test suppliers (OSATS), as well as suppliers of equipment and consumables to the semiconductor industry. In total, more than 400 people participated in this year’s event.

                                Thirty-two technical presentations were delivered by suppliers, end-users and engineering professionals. The presentations underscored the event’s theme of test fundamentals applied to leading edge applications legacy challenges. One of the event’s largest poster sessions reinforced the theme and highlighted related and contemporary topics.

                                General Chairman for the Burn-in and Test Strategies workshop. “This year, over
                                36% of participants were international visitors to Mesa, AZ. And professional and overall participation was up by greater than 20% compared to last year.
