                               Indium Corporation’s Graham Wilson, an Applications Engineer, is scheduled to present his paper entitled “Sn+ Heat-Spring® Solder TIMs for Superior Thermal Management,” at the IMAPS France Workshop on Thermal Management (La Rochelle, France, 2/5/15) at the time of this writing. The paper explores how Heat-Spring thermal interface materials (TIMs) perform against phase change materials and thermal greases under a variety of conditions. Comparative results as they relate to power cycling and bake testing will  be presented and the advantages of using the technology will also be discussed.

                                To get a perspective on the topic in advance of the event, <i>Chip Scale Review</i> asked Indium to comment on select aspects of metallic thermal interface performance. Tim Jensen, Senior Product Manager, Engineered Solders, told <i>CSR</i> that the TIMs used in the company’s new Heat-Spring meet specific thermal performance requirements, which are measured as thermal resistance for the TIM with the application parameters of clamping force applied, finish and flatness of the contacting surfaces, and mounting orientation. Long-term product life requirements are also a consideration. “Operation at an elevated temperature is a primary determinant of failure over time of a semiconductor,” explained Jensen. “The purpose of a TIM material is to avoid an increase in the temperature of the die to the threshold temperature for failure.” Jensen further noted that moving heat from the critical die surface through the package to an external heat sink is a critical design element used to improve package performance and eliminate thermal constraints on operation, while improving system reliability. “A significant percentage of package thermal resistance is found in the thermal interface materials, therefore, improvements obtained by specifying a TIM with demonstrated performance that exceeds that of the best traditional material, such as a silicone-based thermal compound, is a first step in design.”
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-indent:15px;">
                                Awareness of the need to eliminate silicone compounds is increasing, commented Jensen, with some major power semiconductor manufacturers specifying that no TIM may be used that contains a silicone oil carrier. “Metallic TIMs, such as the Heat-Spring and associated indium alloy shims, also meet other system-level requirements,” said Jensen. Included in these requirements are: elimination of the use of a thermal compound that contains silicone oil, a very common carrier; elimination of any concern for outgassing of the silicone; re-deposition on sensitive electrical interconnects and optical lenses and components; and removal of concerns for what is termed “dry-out” within the interface. “The condition termed “dry-out” occurs as both outgassing and physical migration of the silicone oil carrier that occurs over time, and with temperature and cycling.”
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-indent:15px;">
                                Other relevant material properties for TIMs include surface contact and improvement with cycling and temperature. “Unlike many other TIMs, such as graphite sheets and die-cut preforms of several types, the Heat-Spring product demonstrates thermal resistance improvements with time and temperature,” Jensen told <i>CSR</i>. “Silicone-based thermal compounds frequently have been shown to demonstrate a worsening of thermal resistance in the interface over time and temperature because of silicone outgassing, migration, and pump-out.”

                               <b>Figure 1 </b>compares four types of TIM products, including two different commercial brands of relatively high-performance silicone-based thermal grease and two metallic TIM materials, an indium metal flat foil with no patterning (0.003”-thick) and an Indium Corporation Heat-Spring® patterned metallic indium foil (0.003”-thick). Jensen explained that the two metal TIMs perform better than either thermal grease, above 140PSI applied clamping force. “The Heat-Spring patterned metallic TIM outperforms both of the well-known thermal greases at any clamping force greater than approximately 45PSI (.3MPA). Jensen further noted that the Heat-Spring makes intimate contact with the two contacting (source and heat sink) surfaces, and the pattern or texture (visible to the eye) is not a cosmetic enhancement. “The patterning of the Heat-Spring provides an array of compressible columns in the metal, and each of these columns conforms to the roughness and geometry of the mating contact surfaces within the interface.”
