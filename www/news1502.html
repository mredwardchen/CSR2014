                                <h4> SEMI European 3D TSV Summit 2015</h4>
                                        <p>
                                         In January 2015, Grenoble hosted its third edition of the European 3D TSV Summit— SEMI Europe’s flagship event focused on 2.5 and 3D integration. Attracting 250 executives and experts from 22 countries to discuss the latest updates in the realm of TSV, the event was a veritable success with more than 9 out of 10 participants rating the event as “good” or “very good.”
                                        </p><p>

                                         Over the course of the two-day summit, attendees had the opportunity to hear from three keynote speakers, 21 invited speakers, and an expert panel discussion. In addition to the high-caliber conference program, attendees were able to visit an industry exhibition focused uniquely on 3D TSV, schedule 1-on-1 business meetings, visit CEA-Leti’s 300mm TSV cleanroom, and benefit from the numerous networking opportunities offered to them. The event was sponsored by 20 important actors in the industry.
                                           </p><p>
                                         SEMI kicked off the summit on January 19 with a dedicated market briefing session, where attendees were presented with the market trends to expect for
                                         2.5 and 3D technologies. Of particular note, two presentations made by market experts Barnett Silver of ATR EG and Scott Jones of AlixPartners approached TSV and advanced packaging with a fresh perspective.
                                         </p><p>
                                            On day two of the summit, Bryan Black from AMD and Timo Henttonen from Microsoft delivered keynote addresses. In the morning, Black announced that 3D stacking “ is happening” and that AMD is now launching new products that integrate TSV technology. In the afternoon, Henttonen was a bit more measured , expressing that from his viewpoint, many issues still need to be tackled in order to integrate 2.5 or 3D products using TSV

                                         technology in consumer products like smartphones. He insisted that yield and test pose the greatest challenges to the development of the technology. Qualcomm, ams, CEA-Leti, imec, Fraunhofer, and many equipment and materials companies also shared their perspectives and their recent progress in the realm of 3D TSVs.

                                         On the closing day of the summit, the third and final keynote speaker took the stage: CP Hung from ASE Group. Hung explained how TSV technology is being assimilated into packaging’s DNA. Also on this last day, SEMI chose to highlight two topics that are ever more important to the
                                         3D TSV industry: interposers and silicon photonics. The first session on interposers hosted Corning and Asahi Glass, who presented both glass and silicon interposers from a  technological  perspective. STMicroelectronics gave the networking processor product perspective, and Rudolph Technologies addressed the topic from a business and supply chain perspective. For the second session on silicon photonics, IBM and HP explained what advantages TSV and 2.5D integration could bring to next-generation photonics products and the business opportunities it would create.

                                         The Gala Dinner - one of the “non- technological” highlights of the Summit – took place in a French Chateau this year. Attendees enjoyed a friendly atmosphere, good French food and wine, and a relaxed setting that lent itself to networking and the development of business relationships.
                                         A l l  proceedings  of  the  Semi European  3D  TSV  Summit  can  be purchased online on the event’s website (www.semi.org/european3dtsvsummit). Next year’s edition of the event has already been announced for January 18-20, 2016 in Grenoble (France).

                                    Vila do Conde, 10th February 2015 - NANIUM S. A., an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test provider acknowledged for its leadership in advanced packaging, celebrates today its 5th anniversary as an independent company.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Though apparently young, the company has close to twenty years of expertise in the semiconductor industry since its inception in 1996 as Siemens Semiconductors. Throughout these years, it has been active in high-volume semiconductor packaging, assembly and test, providing backend turnkey solutions. First focusing on metal leadframe-based packages like TSOP, the year 2000 witnessed a shift towards organic laminated-based packages like BGA and LGA. In 2008, the manufacturing site in Vila do Conde assembled and tested an average of 15 million BGA components per week.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In 2010, NANIUM entered the outsourced market of 300mm Wafer-Level Packaging and was among the first to offer Fan-Out WLP/ eWLB, a technology that combines minimal form-factor with superior electrical and thermal performance, as well as maximum reliability. Currently considered a frontrunner in FO-WLP, it provides embedded integration solutions that stem from single- dual- and multi-die, to multi-component, face-to-face and system-in-package with or without passive integration. Acknowledged for developing innovative solutions, the company also provides Fan-In WLP/ WLCSP services, and got known for having recently launched the worldwide industry’s largest Fan-In WLP.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    NANIUM is active in markets such as mobile communication, medical, security, wearables and automotive radars, to name a few. Based in Portugal, its facilities include over 20 000 m2 of cleanroom area, making it the largest OSAT in Europe. NANIUM offers in-house capabilities for the entire development chain, from design to the flexibility to tailor and test customized solutions.
