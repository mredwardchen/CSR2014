<p class="title">San Jose, CA - April 3, 2013 Amkor Technology Customer Symposium "Solutions for a Connected World"</p>

<p><i>By Chip Scale Review Staff</i></p>

<p><img src="0413/amkor-logo.jpg" align="left" style="margin:5px;" />Amkor Technology came in force to deliver a highly focused message to an estimated audience of 300 invited customers of Amkor as to exactly what is essential in the packaging & OSAT supplier's world.  The Symposium was staffed by the senior executives, managers and technologists of the company. The mission was clear and the objective precise, it was to deliver the company's current and go forward mission.</p>

<p>The opening remarks by Ken Joyce, president and CEO, provided a broad based overview of the company's current state and new business initiatives. Ken addressed Amkor's CAPEX plan, specifically in Asia-Pacific, where the existing manufacturing facilities and new plants under construction provide  5.8 million sq/ft of facilities. The largest capacities will be centered in the Inchon, Korea area. Scott

Clifford, VP of Strategic Sales & Marketing meticulously detailed the market outlook and corporate initiatives. Technology developments and the challenges for the coming decade were thoughtfully delivered by Dr. ChoonHeung Lee, Corporate VP of Product Management, to the focused audience. Mike Lamble, Executive VP of Sales & Marketing, was the Symposium host and Deborah Patterson, Sr. Director of Product and Technology Marketing for Amkor skillfully organized and directed the event. A comprehensive report on the major trends shaping the future of the semiconductor industry was delivered by Bill McClean, President of IC Insights and the Symposium's Keynote speaker. </p>

<p>The morning session was wrapped up with a very interesting drill down to advanced packaging solutions and a comparative technology roadmap of Amkor's advanced packaging goals as currently viewed by the company and presented by Ron Huemoller, Sr. VP of Advanced Product Development.</p>

<p>Following a buffet style lunch, the afternoon sessions were comprised of 3 technology tracks: Miniaturization & All Things Mobile; Automotive, Industrial & Power; and finally a Networks, Wired Communications and Computing segment. As we sampled all of the break-outs, we studied the attention levels that clearly indicated the relevancy of the materials and topics for the individual tracks.  All sessions and topics were articulated by VPs and Directors from all divisions of Amkor Technology. The broad range of materials included many wafer-level packaging strategies and solutions, MEMS trends and assembly processing, packaging requirements, modeling and predictive engineering, and testing concepts. We found the topics and presentation materials as follows.</p>

<p><b>Track1, Miniaturization & All Things Mobile</b>, targeted the aggressive trend to pack more function into devices that are constrained by form factor, electrical or thermal limitations, or a lack of space within larger systems.  The market for handsets, tablets, or even wearable devices, has been very active in driving miniaturization and 3D packaging.  To this end, wafer level packaging (WLP or WLCSP) and chip scale packaging (CSP) dominate.  Both package platforms, as well as variants such as package-on-package (PoP), were presented in the first and second halves of Track 1, respectively.  Board level reliability and electromigration considerations for various WLCSP structures were also presented.  The effect of design and material parameters on reliability and how to design for enhanced reliability and current carrying capacity was discussed.  An update on the use of newer package types such as wafer level fan-out (WLFO) and through silicon via (TSV) was provided.  MEMs packaging within the mobile environment completed the first half of the track.</p>

<p>The second half of the track focused on flip chip CSPs.  Coreless substrates for next generation applications processors, sensors with TSV and wafer-on-wafer and chip-on-chip attach, GaAs packaging, millimeter wafer (60GHz) packaging, and an overview of package assembly considerations were presented (pitch, underfill, and process tradeoffs) to track attendees. Bump layout and flip chip BGA high level guidelines were also included in the coverage.</p>
 
<p>Downstream thermal and electrical interactions must also be understood and were highlighted with contributions from Amkor's engineering services team through relevant case studies within each track.  Therefore, the track included an overview for thermal design in the tablet environment.  High conductivity substrates, heat spreaders and components for burst thermal storage - within the scope of a tablet's power management considerations &ndash; were inclusive in the material reviewed.  Session presenters also provided electrical design support considerations (from single die substrate to multi-die SiP) and an overview of system integration that provided the audience with varying footprint, materials and explained the performance tradeoffs. A segment on MEMS and SiP test concluded the track with a brief introduction to systems level package test and one box solutions (with a WLAN case study).</p>

<p><b>Track 2, Automotive, Power & Industrial.</b>  Automotive, industrial and power markets are predominantly supported by leadframe and sensor semiconductor packaging.  These include dual and quad lead frame packages, including the ever-popular MicroLeadFrame&reg; platform (QFN/SON/DFN). Cavity or molded FBGAs (e.g., LGA, BGA, WLCSP), MLFs and other lead frame packages feed many sensor footprints.  In addition to a long history of products supporting these applications, the automotive environment compels a zero defect mindset and robust process and control systems.</p>

<p>MLF platforms, with double digit CAGR, are used to support a variety of applications.  In automobiles, they can be found in navigation and entertainment systems and in the camera modules used in backup systems, side alerts, and front traffic monitor systems.  They are found in safety systems (e.g., air bags, ABS, entry security and image and motion sensors) and also support MEMS and sensors (e.g., comfort control systems, pressure sensors, accelerometers, gyros and magnetometers).  Aside from automotive applications, optical sensors for PCs, flow sensors for HVACs, as well as toys, games and even fingerprint sensors all employ MLF packaging.  Power QFNs are of particular interest in the coming decade with much customer activity focused on this platform.  Another variant, flip chip MLF, discussed in the fourth presentation, is driving speed into the GHz range with lower internal impedance to minimize power loss and also provides for high thermal performance in a smaller package footprint.</p>

<p>Both power dissipation and cost reduction are primary considerations in today's systems.  Power packaging utilizing Pb-free material must demonstrate equivalent or superior performance and  is a significant area of activity at Amkor.</p>

<p>Investments driving cost reduction and alternatives to Au wire bonding were covered. Meanwhile, larger and denser leadframe formats continue to be employed.  Driving cost down for larger ICs with more I/Os is an area where the company offers multiple solutions for both leadframe and BGA formats. At one end, Amkor continues to develop cost effective leadframe options - that avoid laminate solutions - such as routable, thin QFN and FusionQuad&reg; (a TQFP with MLD-type leads) packages. On the other end, thinner gold wire or copper wire replacement in PBGAs that significantly reduce package costs completed the final presentation of the day. </p>

<p>Concurrent with the status of these package options, the impact of electromigration on Pb-free copper pillar flip chip bumps that are being incorporated into some of these packages was also presented. Other areas of significant program activity included multi-die stacked laminate CSP and BGA packages and copper wire qualification and production.</p>

<p>The track would not be complete without MEMS and sensor cavity packages.  Material selection for reliability and stress sensitivity and packaging trends were also presented in this track.
A test overview helped identify the best selection of test equipment to be used over the entire product life cycle.  A review of tri-temperature probers/handlers, high power devices and new package pre-work, plus automotive burn-in, high G and adaptive test completed this track.</p>

<p><b>Track 3, Networks, Wired Communications and Computing,</b>  highlighted high-end BGA packaging as well as new developments in both SoC and 2.5/3D configurations.  Within this package segment, cost/performance considerations, wire bond to flip chip BGA migration, and technology options and tradeoffs received examination.  Test strategies followed the business unit overview as considerations for cost effective equipment utilization was reviewed.  This included assessments on existing set up and the elimination of instruments and/or conversion to cost effective testers.   Maximizing parallelism, the testing of multichip platforms and stacked packages as well as high power dissipation, large/thin die, and copper pillar probe were effectively summarized.  Understanding distributed test flow strategies for MCM/SiP, TSV, and interposers allow for both efficiencies in timing as well as a judicious approach to controlling cost. </p>

<p>Designing thermal margin into high speed packaging focused on FCBGA thermal dissipation considerations along with power distribution (hot spots), heat sinks and lid options.  Their experience in package level reliability of thermal interface materials (and their testing) is significant and can help define thermal reliability expectations for the management of increased power per area, hot spots, warpage, etc.</p>
  
<p>Design for high speed digital performance and system functionality focused on ultra-high speed signals, coreless/low impedance substrate materials, and considerations driving module packaging with memory (DDR3 and DDR4) at both the package and motherboard level.</p>

<p>The second half of the track was devoted to next generation package trends from small SoC wafer level package (WLCSP) migration for non-mobile applications (SiP, embedded die) to complex 2.5/3D stacked structures using through silicon vias (TSV). The acceleration of 2.5D product activity, the expanding interposer supply chain and Amkor's assembly experience was reviewed and presented with a solid expertise of the subject matter.</p>

<p>Equally important was the simulated and empirical data that has been accumulated to provide a foundation of chip-to-package interactions, electromigration for 2.5/3D stacks and ongoing analysis and predictive feedback on new programs.  To this end, the company has also developed material property extraction methods for "predictive" package characterization to reaffirm, as well as accelerate, the reliability test cycle. Questions such as "Do materials in my package possess the properties stated in the data sheet?" were discussed.  The company's engineering group has developed accurate material input informing models and live package capture.  Measurement techniques and their varying impact on output data re: DMA testing, Nanoindentation, etc. closed out the track presentation.</p>

<p>In summary, Amkor Technology's presentation of the  information was polished, accurate and skillfully delivered. We look forward to a repeat performance of this venue.</p>

<p>To close out the full day's activities, a casual networking cocktail hour provided appetizers and a few drinks for all.</p>
