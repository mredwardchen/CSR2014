<p class="title">Large Silicon, Glass or Low-CTE Organic Package to Printed Wiring Board SMT Interconnections</p>

<p><i>P. M. Raj, Xian Qin, Jialing Tong, Gary Menezes, Vanessa Smet and Rao Tummala<br />
Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology</i></p>


<p><b>I. INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>Large, low-TCE packages are required in both high-performance, as 2.5D packages in sizes as large as 60 mm and with lithographic ground rules below 5 microns, as well as in consumer electronics. These low-TCE packages are also needed to avoid stress on the ultra-low k dielectrics within the chip, as they tend to be fragile. Low-TCE packages are required in modern consumer applications to minimize thickness.</p> 

<p>Most of today's packages are made of high-CTE organic materials, as illustrated in Fig 1a., as  they are widely available, readily processable and cost efficient. However, these materials present several fundamental limitations in meeting emerging system performance and reliability targets.  The limitations arise because of their poor dimensional stability, leading to coarse lithography rules and bump pitch, large CTE mismatch with the IC, resulting in excessive stresses in the interconnections and in ultra-low K dielectric layers, warpage during fabrication and assembly adversely affecting the assembly yield and reliability both at chip and board-level assemblies.</p>



<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="0713/smt-img1.jpg" border="0" />
    <p style="text-align:left">Fig. 1: Comparison between a. current approach, b. 2.5D interposer-on-package approach and c. GT-PRC's approach) for direct board-level interconnections and reliability (BLIAR).</p>
</div>


 
<p>Silicon and glass packages have silicon-matched CTE and outstanding dimensional stability compared to their organic counterparts, which allow for high-density interconnections at I/O pitches of less than 40 microns. With such ideal properties, these interposers and packages are projected to become prevalent in both 2.5D and 3D architectures. Organic substrate manufacturers are also addressing this problem of CTE mismatch and dimensional stability by development of advanced low CTE polymer-glass composites with high glass-transition temperatures (Tg).</p>
	
    Fig. 1a compares the traditional chip-package-PWB assembly with the current interposer-on-package approach in Fig. 1b with large, and low-CTE interposer-to-package-to-board interconnections and, in Fig. 1c, the GT-PRC's approach for direct board-level interconnections. Consumer products such as smartphones can afford neither the increased cost   nor   increased thickness that comes with the use of interposer-on package approach shown in Fig 1b.
    
<p>For wide acceptance of low CTE packages in high-volume production, it is critical to assemble them on-board using standard Surface-Mount Technologies (SMT) with high degree of automation, reduced labor costs and high production rates. These require compatibility with high-throughput pick-and-place tools and processes such as standard solder-paste printing, BGA ball placement, and reflow. Low-cost SMT-compatible interconnection technologies at small pitches with large package sizes are, therefore, highly sought after for direct assembly to the board, thus eliminating the need for additional packaging levels. This constitutes GT-PRC's strategy for board level assembly and reliability (BLIAR), as illustrated in Fig.1c. Since the biggest barrier to system miniaturization is SMT pitch, GT PRC proposes to develop materials, processes and tools, in partnership with EMS companies, to bring the SMT pitch below 300 microns. This is consistent with ITRS Roadmap, for fine-pitch ball grid array (FBGA) packages that are projected to reach below 200 &micro;m pitch for area array in 2016.</p> 

<p><b>LARGE-PACKAGE TO BOARD SMT CHALLENGES</b></p>

<p>Large and low-CTE package-to-board SMT interconnections present many technical and manufacturing challenges. These challenges include decoupling of CTE-related stress at board-level and materials and processes necessary to accommodate warpage and non-coplanarity,   as well as manufacturing tools and processes necessary for high-volume SMT manufacturing.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="0713/smt-img2.jpg" border="0" />
    <p style="text-align:left">Fig. 2a Large 125 mm LTCC Pin Grid Array (PGA) package (Courtesy: IBM), 2b small wafer-level package (TI).</p>
</div>

 
<p><b>II.	CURRENT MANUFACTURING APPROACHES</b></p>
<p>Low-CTE package-to-board interconnections are currently used in two types of products, as shown in Fig. 2a, large ceramic multichip packages, and 2b, small wafer level packages.  The large ceramic packages are pin grid array (PGA) and land grid array (LGA) packages that are as big as 125 mm in size   manufactured by IBM and others [3]. These,  the most advanced  packages interconnecting   as many as 100 chips on a single package, were developed in the 1980s and are still applied today in high performance computing applications. These ceramic packages are not produced in high volume and hence SMT-compatibility for low cost is not a requirement. They are either fabricated with very high aspect ratio pins (PGAs), which act as compliant structures, or as LGAs requiring socket-based board-level interconnections. However, these approaches have not been scaled to much below 1000 &micro;m pitch.</p>

<p>Wafer-level package is another type of low-CTE package that is produced in high-volume. These are smaller in size, typically 5 mm, and are assembled to the board using standard SMT processes. The stress in the joint is low enough not to require any stress-relief solutions.</p>
 

<p><b>III.	POTENTIAL STRESS RELIEF APPROAHES: COMPLIANT INTERCONNECTIONS</b></p>
<p>Low-CTE package-on-board assembly faces similar challenges as those encountered in IC interconnections on organic packages as well as large wafer-level packages on board. Potential stress -management approaches that have been explored and developed for these applications, can be applied, at least in principle for  decoupling stress with direct  board  assembly, as briefly described  below.</p>

<p><i>A.	Compliance through polymer bumps</i></p>
<p>Polymer bumps embedded under the patterned die metallization, or as a core inside a metal shell are known to form compliant interconnects. The Elastic-bump on Silicon Technology (ELAStec) introduced in Fig. 3 relies on compliant polymer bumps as electrical contacts for simplified wafer probing and for enhanced reliability achieved through the polymer compliance. Polymer bumps are first printed on the die surface followed by electro-deposition of copper-nickel redistribution layers over the bumps. Probing pads and bumps are electrically connected with fine metal traces formed by sputtering and electroplating. High reliability has been demonstrated with this technology for small die sizes thanks to stress-relief from the elastic bumps [4].</p>


<div style="text-align:center">

    <p style="text-align:left">Fig. 3a ELAStec interconnect Approach [4] (Courtesy: Infineon). Fig. 3b   Super CSPTM Approach by Fujitsu[7].</p>
</div>




<p><i>B.	Compliance through high-aspect ratio metal leads</i></p>
<p><i>1)	Sea of leads (SoL)</i></p>
<p>Non-adherent 'compliant' leads are the basis of the high-density compliant interconnects known as sea of leads (SoL). In-plane compliance is provided by decoupling of the leads from the interposer surface (free-standing structures) while z-axis compliance is enhanced by the additionally embedded air gaps that are formed. Moreover, compliance can be tailored by changing the leads orientation for specific applications. From an electrical standpoint, the SoL technology has shown high electrical performance from DC to 45 GHz with nominal DC resistance near 20 mO and parasitic inductance below 0.1 nH. However, due to its complexity, the SoL process has not been applied as an SMT process to-date. [5].</p>
<p><i>2)	Double- solder balls for height increase</i>
<p>Double solder ball interconnects consist of two solder balls stacked one above the other for increased stand-off height. The upper bump is enclosed in an epoxy shell for stress redistribution. The double solder ball structure is highly reliable and has proved to pass traditional component reliability tests such as 1000 cycles TCT under -55o/+125o. Although this technology is compatible with SMT processes, as it uses classic solder ball technologies, the process has not been applied to SMT. [6].</p> 
<p><i>3)	Wafer-level chip-scale package (Super CSPTM)</i> 
<p>Super CSPTM, shown in Fig. 3b, is an approach of WLCSP where stress-relief is provided by copper posts and the encapsulant surrounding them. It has excellent electrical performance and package reliability due to copper's low resistivity and stress-relief arising from the increased stand-off height respectively. This package also enables smaller PWB area, with much simpler test and burn-in than Known Good Die (KGD) [7].</p>

<p><i>4)	G-Helix compliant interconnects</i>
<p>G-Helix is an electroplated, compliant, off-chip and underfill-free interconnection with two end posts. Conventional fabrication technologies, such as lithography and electroplating, are used to fabricate G-Helix, enabling a wafer-level process. Thanks to its good three-dimensional mechanical compliance, G-Helix can effectively accommodate the displacement caused by CTE mismatch and substrate non-planarity. Based on FEM simulations of thermo-mechanical reliability, chip-level assembly on organic substrates with G-Helix interconnects without underfill passed more than 1000 thermal cycles. However, electrical parasitics increase with the degree of mechanical compliance. Thus, with the G-Helix approach, or with any compliant approaches, a trade-off between mechanical and electrical performances arises [8].</p>
<p><b>IV.	EMERGING  APPROACHES</b> </p>
<p>Innovative and comprehensive low-cost stress-relief solutions to enhance board-level interconnection reliability with large low-CTE packages, going beyond the traditional PGA and WLP-based approaches described above are required. Four innovative stress-relief approaches, shown in Fig.4, are being developed by the Georgia Tech team: a.) polymer stress-buffer layers, b.) polymer collar, c.) compliant metal structure inserts, and d.) reworkable underfills. In the first approach, the stress induced by CTE mismatch is buffered through polymer layers built up on both sides of the interposer. Thanks to its low modulus and high compliance, the stress-buffer layer deforms when subjected to differential thermal expansion by reducing plastic strain in the solder joints [9]. Stress-relief in the solder joints can also be achieved using high-CTE buffer layers which effectively increase the package CTE. Xian et al. have demonstrated up to 1,900 thermal cycles with high CTE glass interposers on organic packages. In addition, it was found that board-level reliability can be further enhanced by increasing the polymer thickness [10]. </p>

</div>



<p>In the second approach, a new class of polymer collar materials is investigated to enhance board-level reliability without compromising reworkability. The polymer collar provides an additional stress-distribution layer at the solder-to-pad interface to enhance the reliability of large-body-size interposers by reducing plastic strain in the solder joints. Kim et al. have shown that the region around the interface of the solder and UBM receives the most stress under temperature cycling [11]. The polymer collar surrounds the solder-to-UBM interface, blocking shear deformation of the joints to reduce crack formation.</p> 


<p>The third approach is based on stress-relief provided by compliant metal-based structures. Innovative methods relying on compliant metal-based stress-relief inserts that are prefabricated and inserted in an SMT-compatible sequence are currently pursued by GT-PRC [12].</p>
Underfills, removable with mild processes for easy reworkability constitute the 4th approach. Reliability is here enhanced without any additional process steps on the interposer and without increasing resistance or inductance. A high stiffness of the underfill is critical to act as an efficient stress redistribution layer. Stiffness enhancement is achieved through the incorporation of fillers without affecting assembly reworkability.</p>

<p><b>V.	SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</b></p>
<p>The trend to heterogeneous integration with multiple high I/O density ICs is driving the industry towards large packages with shrinking package ground rules and pitch, requiring a new set of low-CTE glass, silicon or organic interposers or packages. These large low-CTE interposers and packages, however, pose many challenges. If they are used as interposers, they end up adding an additional package level with increased thickness, cost and electrical parasitic. If they are used as packages they pose interconnection reliability challenges when directly assembled on the organic board with standard SMT processes because of the large CTE mismatch. Current large low-CTE PGAs or LGAs are not assembled using standard SMT processes. Wafer-level packages, on the other hand, are small in size and thus do not require any major deviation from standard SMT processes. New approaches extending stress-relief mechanisms such as copper pillars, elastic bumps, compliant metal or polymer structures can offer potential solutions to  direct SMT assembly as  briefly reviewed in this paper  Finally, four innovative approaches under development at Georgia Tech's -PRC, and other institutes, to address board-level SMT interconnection challenges, were introduced.</p>
