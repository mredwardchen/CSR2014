<p class="title">Supply Chains for High-Volume Manufacturing of 3D IC Integration</p>
<p><i>by John H. Lau [ITRI]</i></p>
<p>3D IC integration is taking the semiconductor industry by storm. It has been: (a) impacting the chip suppliers, fables design houses, foundries, integrated device manufacturers, outsourced semiconductor assembly & test, substrates,  electronic manufacturing service, original design manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, material and equipment suppliers, universities, and research institutes; (b) attracting the researchers and engineers from all over the world to go to conferences, lectures, workshops, panels, forums, and meetings to present their findings, exchange information, look for solutions, learn the latest technologies, and plan for their future; and (c) pushing the industry to build standards, ecosystems and infrastructures for 3D IC integration.</p> 
<p>This is a perfect storm! People and companies think that Moore's law is going to take a bow soon and 3D IC integration is the next one. In order to prepare for their future and have a competitive edge, they have been investing heavily on both human and physical resources for 3D IC integration.</p> 
<p>The potential applications and high-volume manufacturing (HVM) of 3D IC integrations is shown in <b>Figure 1</b> [1]. Basically it can be classified into 4 groups, namely; memory-chip stacking, wide I/O memory (or logic-on-logic), wide I/O DRAM, and wide I/O interface (or 2.5D IC integration).</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="1112/Slide1.jpg" width="500" />
	<p>Figure 1: Potential applications and high-volume manufacturing of 3D IC integration</p>
</div>
<p><b>Memory-Chip Stacking</b></p>
<p>The drawing and sample in the far-left of <b>Figure 1</b> show the simplest example of memory-chip stacking published by Samsung in 2006. These chips could be DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) or NADA Flash with less than 100 I/Os (78 to be exact). Even with eight-chip stacking, their total thickness (560&micro;m) is still less than that of an ordinary chip (this is significant!) This memory-chip stack is attached to an organic substrate. Unfortunately, due to cost issue and competing wire bonding technology, memory-chip stacking with TSVs is not in volume production today for consumer products. Currently, Samsung  is shooting for the next-generation server products and most likely is considering going with the DDR4 (double data rate &mdash; type 4) SDRAM (synchronous DRAM).</p> 

<p><b>Wide I/O Memory or Logic-on-Logic</b></p>
<p>The second column on the left-hand side of Figure 1 shows a wide I/O memory, which consists of low-power consumption and wide-bandwidth memory usually with more than thousands of interface pins. This memory is supported by a CPU/logic or SoC with TSVs, which is called an active interposer. This wide I/O memory module is attached to an organic substrate. Since mobile products such as smartphones want it, samples have been made and published by, for example, Samsung. Unfortunately, the readiness of the fabless supply chain infrastructure, including industry standards, supply chain business models, and competitive pricing, takes time and is not here yet! Logic-on-logic falls into this category.</p>

<p><b>Wide I/O DRAM (HMC)</b></p>
<p>The third column on the right-hand side of <b>Figure 1</b> shows a wide I/O DRAM. Samsung has been publishing many papers on this topic for at least three years [2] and finally, at the 2011 IEEE ISSCC in San Francisco, the company showed the sample of two DRAMs on a master controller logic chip (or SoC) with TSVs, which is called an active interposer. For this DRAM, the number of TSVs and interface pins is slightly more than one thousand. The JEDEC standard defines this structure as having 1200 I/O pins in four channels (<a href="http://www.jedec.org/" class="link">http://www.jedec.org/</a>). This wide I/O DRAM module is attached to an organic substrate. Recently, the Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) consortium, which includes such companies as Micron, Samsung, Altera, ARM, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft, Open-Silicon, SK Hynix and Xilinx, announced that a specification will be opened to the public by the end of this year. The specification is primarily targeted at high-performance networking, industrial, and test and measurement applications. IBM has also suggested it will use the cubes for high-end servers.</p> 

<p><b>Wide I/O Interface with Passive Interposers (2.5D IC Integration)</b></p>
<p>The far right-hand side of <b>Figure 1</b> shows a wide I/O interface for router/telecommunication/next-generation servers/high-performance applications. The Moore's law chips (i.e., without any TSVs) have memory/ASIC/CPU/... and the I/O could be between hundreds and thousands, which are supported by a piece of silicon with TSVs and redistribution layers (RDLs). The sample in <b>Figure 1</b> is presented by Xilinx [3-6], where the FPGA (field-programmable gate array) is fabricated by TSMC's 28nm process technology and the interposer is at 65nm. There are four RDLs on top of the interposer that lets those four FPGAs communicate to each other over very short distances.</p> 
<p>The technology supply chains for these four groups of potential applications and HVM of 3D IC integration are discussed below. The thickness of the memory-chip stacking and DRAMs in the HMC is &#8804;50&micro;m. Also, the thickness of the active and passive interposers is &#8804;200&micro;m. Only chip-to-wafer (C2W) bonding is considered (supporting supply chains, such as materials and equipment, will not be mentioned). Though EDA (electronic design automation) supply chains are very important, they are not discussed in the present study. Vertically integrated companies such as Samsung and TSMC, which want to be the technology supply chain (i.e., do it all), also will not be discussed in this study.</p>

<p><b>Technology Supply Chains Before the TSV Era</b></p>
<p>Before the TSV era, the technology supply chains are very well defined and understood. Descriptions of the various entities comprising the supply chain before the TSV era are presented below:

<p><b>FEOL (front-end-of-line)</b>. This is the first portion of IC fabrication where the individual devices such as transistors or resistors are patterned. This process is from a bare wafer to (but not including) the deposition of metal layers. FEOL is usually performed in semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs).</p>

<p><b>BEOL (back-end-of-line)</b>. This is the fabrication in which active devices are interconnected with wiring on the wafer. This process starts from the first layer of metal to bonding pads with passivation. It also includes insulators and metal contacts and is called<b> MOL </b>(middle-of-the-line). The term "MOL" is seldom used and embedded in the BEOL. Again, BEOL is usually performed in the fab.</p>

<p><b>OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test)</b>. This term is also called packaging, assembly and test. The process starts when the passivated wafer is received from the fab and then goes through circuit probing/bumping/thinning/dicing/wiring bonding/flip-chip/molding/ball mounting/final testing.</p> 

<p><b>Technology Supply Chains for the TSV Era</b></p>
The topic of supply chains in the TSV era will be discussed in three parts: A) Who makes the TSV? B) Who does the MEOL? C) Who performs the critical steps (including FEOL, MOL, BEOL, TSV, MEOL, assembly and test) and their ownership for making these four groups of 3D IC integrations shown in <b>Figure 1</b>.</p>

<p><b>A) Who Makes the TSV</b>. The following steps in the TSV fabrication process impact the various considerations that must be addressed:</p>

<p><b>TSVs Fabricated by the Via-First Process:</b> The TSVs are fabricated before the FEOL. This can only be done by the fab. However, even in the fab, this seldom happens because the devices (e.g., transistors) are much more important than the TSVs.</p>

<p><b>TSVs Fabricated by the Via-Middle Process:</b> The TSVs are fabricated right after the FEOL (e.g., transistors) and MOL (e.g., metal contacts), and before the BEOL (e.g., metal layers), for example [7, 8]. In this case, the MOL is no longer embedded in the BEOL because the TSV fabrication process is between them (<b>Figures 2</b> and <b>3</b>). Owing to logistics and equipment compatibilities, usually the TSV by the via-middle process is done by the fab.</p>

	<p>Figure 2: Critical steps and ownerships for (face-to-back) wide I/O memory using the TSV via-middle fabrication process.</p>
</div>
<p><b>TSVs Fabricated by the Via-Last (From the Frontside) Process:</b> The TSVs are fabricated (from the frontside of the wafer) after the FEOL, MOL, and BEOL. As of today, there is not a single paper published with this process.</p>

<p><b>TSVs Fabricated by the Via-Last (From the Backside) Process:</b> The TSVs are fabricated (from the backside of the wafer) after the FEOL, MOL, and BEOL process flows. The CMOS image sensor is an example. Strictly speaking, CMOS image sensors are not examples of 3D IC integration. For CMOS device wafers, the only creditable publication is given by LETI, et al., [9]. However, due to logistics and technical issues, which will be discussed below, TSVs fabricated by the via-last (from the backside) process should be avoided until these issues are resolved.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
	<a href="1112/Slide3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="1112/Slide3.jpg" width="500" /></a>
	<p>Figure 3: Critical steps and ownerships for (face-to-face) wide I/O memory using the TSV via-middle fabrication process.</p>
</div>
<p>Based on the above discussions, it seems that for active device wafers being used for 3D IC integration applications, TSVs are better fabricated using the via-middle process. Also, the TSVs should be fabricated by the fab, where all the equipment and expertise already exist and the cost to fabricate the TSVs is less than 5% of the cost in fabricating the (&#8804;32nm) device wafers!</p>

<p><b>How About the Passive TSV Interposers:</b> When the industry defined the TSV processes for 3D IC integration, there were no passive interposers yet. Also, since there is no active device in the passive interposers, thus they don't fit into any of the preceding!</p>

<p><b>Who Wants to Fabricate the TSV for Passive Interposers:</b> Both the fab and OSAT want to do it! It depends on the layout, design, and fabrication capabilities, especially the line width and spacing of the RDLs. Usually, a few microns of line width and spacing can be done by the OSAT. Otherwise, it should be done by the fab.</p>

<p><b>B) Who Does the MEOL.</b> For the thicknesses of memory-chip stacking and DRAMs in HMC, and active and passive interposers under consideration, all the TSVs fabricated are blind vias. The blind TSV wafer is followed by solder bumping/temporary bonding/back grinding/TSV revealing/thin wafer handling/debonding/cleaning, which, taken together, are called MEOL (middle-end-of-line). In this study, except for the vertically integrated companies (e.g., TSMC and Samsung), it is better for the MEOL process flow to be performed by the OSAT.</p>

<p><b>C)</b> Critical Steps and Ownerships for HVM of 3D IC Integration.</p> 

<p><b>C.1) Wide I/O Memory (Face-to-Back) by the TSV Via-Middle Fabrication Process: Figure 2</b> shows the critical steps and ownerships for this process. After FEOL (to pattern the devices) and MOL (to make the metal contacts), the TSVs are fabricated by five key steps, namely via formation by deep reactive ion etch [10], dielectric deposition by plasma enhance chemical vapor deposition, barrier and seed layer by physical vapor deposition, Cu-filling by electroplating [11], and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to remove the overburden Cu [12]. These steps are then followed by the build up of the metal layers, and finally, the passivation/openings (BEOL). All these steps should be done in the fab.</p>
<p>The MEOL starts off by under bump metallization (UBM) and C4 ordinary wafer bumping with solder to the whole wafer. It is followed by temporary bonding of the TSV wafer to a supporting (carrier) wafer with adhesive [13, 14]. Then back grinding of the TSV wafer to a few microns from the tip of the Cu-filled TSV. It is followed by silicon dry etching to a few microns below the tip of the Cu-filled TSV. After that, a low temperature isolation SiN/SiO2 deposition is applied to the whole wafer. Then CMP is used to remove the SiN/SiO2 and the Cu and seed layers of the Cu-filled TSV (Cu revealing) [12, 15]. Finally, an UBM is built on the tip of the Cu-filled TSV. All these steps should be done by the OSAT.</p>
<p>Separately, the memory wafer is micro bumped with tiny solder bumps [16] or Cu-pillars with solder caps [17]. Then the wafer is diced into individual chips with micro bumps/Cu-pillars. These steps also should be done by the OSAT.
<p>Next is chip-to-wafer (C2W) bonding [18, 19], i.e., the micro bumped memory chip is bonded (either by natural reflow or thermal compression) to the TSV wafer with the carrier. After face-to-back C2W bonding, the carrier wafer is debonded from the TSV wafer. It is followed by dicing the TSV wafer into individual TSV modules. This TSV module is solder (natural) reflowed on a package substrate, then tested. All these C2W bonding, dicing, assembly, and testing steps should be done by the OSAT.

<p><b>C.2) Wide I/O Memory (Face-to-Face) by TSV Via-Middle Fabrication Process:</b> The FEOL, MOL, TSV, and BEOL processes are exactly the same as those done in the TSV via-middle (face-to-back) process. However, the processes that follow it are different. Instead of C4 ordinary wafer bumping with solder after the UBM, the TSV wafer is temporarily bonded to carrier #1. Then, back grinding of the TSV wafer is done and the Cu reveal and UBM are accomplished. Those steps are followed by C4 ordinary wafer bumping with solder and temporary bonding to a second carrier #2. Then carrier #1 is debonded from the TSV wafer and C2W (face-to-face) bonding is performed. After C2W bonding, the carrier #2 is debonded from the TSV wafer. It is followed by dicing the TSV wafer into individual TSV modules. This TSV module is solder reflowed on a package substrate, then tested. The critical steps and their ownerships are shown in <b>Figure 3</b>.

<p><b>C.3) Wide I/O Memory (Face-to-Back) by TSV Via-Last (from the Backside) Fabrication Process: Figure 4</b> shows the critical steps and their ownerships. After FEOL (to pattern the devices), MOL (to make the metal contacts), and BEOL (to build the metal layers and passivation/openings), the UBM and C4 ordinary wafer bumping with solder are fabricated. Then, the structure is temporarily bonded to a carrier wafer. It is followed by backside back grinding, TSV fabrication and passivation/openings, and UBM. 
<p>Next is C2W face-to-back bonding, followed by debonding of the carrier wafer from the TSV wafer, and then the TSV wafer is diced into individual TSV modules. This TSV module is solder reflowed on a package substrate and test.
<div style="text-align:center">

	<p>Figure 4: Critical steps and ownerships for (face-to-back) wide I/O memory using the TSV via-last from the backside fabrication process.</p>
</div>
<p><b>C.4) Wide I/O Memory (Face-to-Face) by TSV Via-Last (from the Backside) Fabrication Process: </b>The FEOL, MOL, and BEOL processes are exactly the same as the (face-to-back) TSV via-last (from the backside) process. However, for the face-to-face case, after the UBM step, the device wafer is temporarily bonded to carrier #1 as shown in <b>Figure 5</b>. Then, the backside is subjected to back grinding, TSV fabrication, and passivation/openings from the backside of the device wafer. These processes are followed by UBM, C4 wafer bumping with solder, and temporary bonding to carrier #2; then debonding from carrier #1 is accomplished.
<div style="text-align:center">
	<a href="1112/Slide5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="1112/Slide5.jpg" width="500" /></a>
	<p>Figure 5: Critical steps and ownerships for (face-to-face) wide I/O memory using the TSV via-last from the backside fabrication process.</p>
</div>
<p>After the above processes are completed, C2W face-to-face bonding is done next. After C2W bonding, the carrier #2 wafer is debonded from the TSV wafer and diced into individual TSV modules. The TSV module is soldered on a package substrate, then test.
<p>From <b>Figures 4</b> and <b>5</b> it can be seen that the TSV can be fabricated by either the fab or OSAT. However, due to the logistics of the process flow, the chance for the fab to do it is very slim. (Once the wafer is out of the fab and processed by the OSAT, it is almost impossible for the wafer to go back to the fab for further processing.) Also, because of technical issues, such as hitting the various embedded alignment targets in the x-, y- and z-directions (to enable the alignment between the metal layers on the topside of the wafer and the positioning of TSVs formed from the backside), it is very challenging for the OSAT. Thus, the TSV via-last (from the backside) fabrication process should be avoided until these issues are resolved.

<p><b>C.5) Wide I/O DRAM by TSV Via-Middle Fabrication Process:</b> After FEOL, MOL, TSV, and BEOL of the DRAM and SoC/logic wafers, the SoC/logic wafer will go through the same steps as shown in <b>Figure 2</b> of section C.1 for face-to-back, or <b>Figure 3</b> of section C.2 for face-to-face. For the DRAMs, UBM is done first followed by micro wafer bumping of the whole wafer. These processes are then followed by temporary bonding to a carrier wafer, back grinding, Cu revealing, and UBM. These in turn are followed by debonding of the carrier wafer and dicing of the TSV DRAM wafer into individual TSV DRAM chips as shown in <b>Figure 6</b>.
<div style="text-align:center">
	<a href="1112/Slide6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="1112/Slide6.jpg" width="500" /></a>
	<p>Figure 6: Critical steps and ownerships for wide I/O DRAM using the TSV via-middle fabrication process.</p>
</div>
<p>The next process is C2W (DRAM chip to SoC/Logic wafer) bonding (e.g., 2-stacking, 4-stacking, 6-stacking or 8-stacking). After C2W bonding, the carrier wafer is debonded from the SoC/Logic wafer and diced into individual hybrid memory cubes (DRAM-stacking + SoC/Logic). These steps are followed by assembly of the hybrid memory cube with over-mold on a package substrate, then testing.

<p><b>C.6) Memory-Chip Stacking by TSV Via-Middle Fabrication Process:</b> The critical steps and ownerships of memory-chip (either DRAM or NAND Flash) stacking are exactly the same as those of the DRAMs of the wide I/O DRAM case as shown in section C.5. However, instead of C2W bonding as in the wide I/O DRAM case, memory-chip stacking is accomplished by stacking the individual TSV chips first and then attaching them to a package substrate and over molded. Following these steps, the TSV memory-chip stacking module is attached to a printed circuit board such as the registered dual in-line memory modules (RDIMMs).

<p><b>C.7) 2.5D IC Integration with TSV/RDL Passive Interposers: Figure 7</b> shows the critical steps and their ownerships. After the deposition of a passivation layer on a piece of dummy silicon (no active devices), the TSV can be fabricated, RDL can be built, and passivation/openings can be made. After the UBM, the TSV wafer is temporarily bonded to carrier #1. It is followed by back grinding, silicon etching, low-temperature passivation, and Cu revealing. Then, UBM, C4 wafer bumping with solder, and temporary bonding to carrier #2 are accomplished. 
Separately, the device wafer without TSVs is subjected to either micro bumping with tiny solder bumps, or Cu-pillars with solder caps. The device wafer is then diced into individual chips with micro bumps/Cu-pillars.
<div style="text-align:center">
	<a href="1112/Slide7.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="1112/Slide7.jpg" width="500" /></a>
	<p>Figure 7: Critical steps and ownerships for 2.5D IC integration with a TSV/RDL passive interposer.</p>
</div>
<p>The next processes to be accomplished are debonding of carrier #1, performing C2W bonding (the device chip to the TSV wafer). After C2W bonding, carrier #2 is debonded and the TSV wafer is diced into individual TSV modules. Finally, the TSV module can be assembled on a package substrate, then tested.
It can be seen from <b>Figure 7</b> that the TSV and RDL can be made by either the fab or the OSAT. It depends on the layout, design, and fabrication capabilities, especially the line width and spacing of the RDLs. Usually, a few microns of line width and spacing can be done by the OSAT. Otherwise, it should be done by the fab.
Except vertically integrated companies, such as TSMC, who want to do the chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) process completely in house, most fabless design houses prefer the fab (e.g., UMC and GlobalFoundries) to make the blind TSVs and the RDLs of the passive interposer. Then, the fabs hand the unfinished "TSV interposer" off to an OSAT for MEOL (solder bumping/temporary bonding/thin wafer handling/back grinding/TSV revealing/debonding/cleaning), assembly and test. This is also true for the unfinished TSV device wafers.

  
<p><b>Summary</b>
<p>The technology supply chains for 3D IC integration manufacturing have been studied. Critical steps such as FEOL, MOL, BEOL, TSV, MEOL, assembly and test, and their ownerships for potential applications and HVM of 3D IC integrations such as memory-chip stacking, wide I/O memory (or logic-on-logic), wide I/O DRAM (or HMC), and wide I/O interface (or 2.5D IC integration), have also been provided and discussed. Some important results and recommendation are summarized as follows:

<li>For device wafers, TSVs fabricated by the via-last from the backside process should be avoided until the logistic and technical issues are resolved.</li>
<li>For device wafers, TSVs fabricated by the via-middle process is the right way to go and should be performed by the fab.</li>
<li>For passive interposers, TSVs can be done by either the fab or OSAT. For =3&micro;m line width and spacing RDLs, either the fab or the OSAT can do it. Otherwise, it should be done by the fab.</li>
<li>For both device wafers and interposer wafers, the MEOL, assembly and test processes should be done by the OSAT (except vertically integrated companies). It can be seen from Figures 2 to 7 that there are many important steps in the MEOL (solder bumping/temporary bonding/back grinding/TSV Cu revealing/thin wafer handling/debonding/cleaning), assembly and test; therefore, the OSATs should strive to make themselves ready for a robust and high-yield manufacturing process.</li>
<li>In order to have a smooth hand-off from the fab to the OSAT of the unfinished TSV wafer, more research and development work should be performed on the testing methods for blind TSV wafers for electrical [20, 21], thermal, [22], and mechanical performance.</li>
</ul>
