                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                InvenSense, Inc. (NYSE: INVN) and GLOBALFOUNDRIES have announced their collaboration on an ultrasonic fingerprint imaging technology for InvenSense UltraPrint Ultrasound Fingerprint Touch Sensor Solution. InvenSense and GF are enabling, for the first time, commercial manufacturing of aluminum nitride-based piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (pMUT).  As a result of the close technological collaboration between InvenSense and GF, InvenSense’s CMOS-MEMS Platform can now be extended to pMUT devices and enable a biometric authentication solution for mobile and IoT products. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mobile OEMs are looking for highly durable, button-free solutions that require fingerprint sensors to be placed behind the cover glass or under metal on the back of the phone. Capacitive sensors, incapable of sensing through metal, can only sense through roughly 0.3mm of glass, which creates durability concerns. InvenSense’s UltraPrint technology enables the use of thicker glass or metal materials without compromising biometric authentication performance. Moreover, the technology enhances fingerprint imaging, enabling the reader to scan even when the user’s skin contains common contaminants such as oils, lotion, or perspiration. These critical factors combined with GF's aluminum-nitride-based manufacturing technology ensure consistent quality for higher-performance devices and can be extended to a secure identification for smartphones, home automation, payment or health-related interactions with wearables. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            
                                “We are pleased to have collaborated closely with GF on the proprietary InvenSense CMOS-MEMS platform (ICMP),” said Mo Maghsoudnia, VP of Technology and Worldwide Manufacturing at InvenSense. “This close technology collaboration has enabled us to advance the manufacturing of ultrasonic imaging technology, resulting in production of our fingerprint authentication solution for a myriad of applications. We look forward to expanding our collaboration into multiple pMUT devices and the delivery of best-in-class products to our customers.” 
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                            
                                “InvenSense’s entry into pMUT provides testimony to our differentiated capabilities on aluminum nitride-based piezoelectric MEMS fabrication technology,” said Gregg Bartlett, SVP, CMOS Business Unit of GF. “This is particularly notable as we broaden the relationship to now include InvenSense’s ultrasonic fingerprint and other process technologies.”

                                Imec and EVG demonstrate for the first time 1.8µm pitch overlay accuracy for wafer bonding 
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                At the 2017 European 3D Summit in Grenoble (France, Jan 23-25), imec and EV Group (EVG) announced an extension to their collaboration, achieving excellent wafer-to-wafer overlay accuracy results in both hybrid bonding and dielectric bonding. Expanding this collaboration, EVG will become a partner in imec’s 3D integration program through a joint development agreement to further improve overlay accuracy in wafer-to-wafer bonding. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wafer-to-wafer bonding is a promising technique for enabling high-density integration of future ICs through three-dimensional (3D) integration. This is achieved by aligning top and bottom wafers that are then bonded, thereby creating a stacked IC. An important advantage is that wafers/ICs with different technologies can be stacked, e.g., memory and processor ICs. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            
                                The companies provided additional background information about their work with the news release. Many of the alignment techniques and bonding methods for 3D integration have evolved from microelectromechanical system (MEMS) fabrication methods. The fundamental difference between MEMS and 3D integration is that the alignment or overlay accuracy has to be improved by 5–10 times. Accurate overlay is needed to align the bonding pads of the stacked wafers and it is essential to achieving a high yield with wafer-to-wafer bonding.

First, the hybrid (via-middle) wafer-to-wafer bonding technique was improved by using EVG’s bonding system that resulted in a high-yield and a 1.8µm pitch (see Figure 1), which is significantly better compared to recently published results at recognized conferences such as ECTC and 3DIC reporting 3.6µm pad size.

                                Second, the dielectric (via-last) wafer-to-wafer bonding technique was tackled by the collaborators. This technique requires extremely good overlay accuracy to align the copper pads from both wafers, which are then contacted by through-silicon vias (TSVs). In this case, 300nm overlay across the wafer was achieved.

                                “By joining forces, we achieved these excellent results on overlay accuracy,” explained Eric Beyne, Fellow at imec. “We are excited that we can expand our collaboration with EVG with a JDP and the installation of EVG’s GEMINI FB XT wafer bonder in our cleanroom. The GEMINI FB XT has the potential to further reduce the wafer-to-wafer overlay errors and therefore allow for the development of sub-micron wafer-to-wafer interconnects technologies.”

                            <p>
                            
                                “Further improving the overlay accuracy for wafer-to-wafer bonding into the sub-200nm range requires optimization of the interaction between the wafer bonding tool and processes as well as pre-and post-processing and the wafer material,” noted Markus Wimplinger, Corporate Technology Development & IP Director at EVG. “We are excited to partner with imec in an effort to advance overlay accuracies for wafer-to-wafer bonding to meet the needs of future 3D IC designs that rely on high density interconnects”

                                Imec’s 3D integration program explores technology options to define innovative solutions for cost-effective realization of 3D interconnect with TSVs. Imec’s 3D integration processes are completely executed on 300mm. Imec also explores 3D design to propose methodologies for critical design issues, enabling effective use of 3D interconnection at the system level.

                                Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has announced the availability of a thermal interface materials (TIM) solution to help smartphone manufacturers and designers effectively manage heat dissipation in their phones. Honeywell pointed out that the worldwide smartphone market is expected to reach more than 1.9 billion units by 2020, according to a study from IDC Research. In addition, data needs are growing at unprecedented rates. To meet this challenge, the smartphone industry is leveraging technology that enables phones to provide optimal processing performance without overheating.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Honeywell’s TIM technology is based on phase change materials (PCMs). The technology transfers thermal energy from phone chips to a heat sink or spreader, where it is dissipated into the surrounding environment. This functionality keeps the chips cool, so the phone can perform reliably even during the most data-intense processes or during heat spikes. According to the company, Honeywell’s solution is available worldwide and is already being used by some of the largest smartphone makers to upgrade the thermal designs of its latest phone models.
                            </p>
                            <p>
    
                                “Honeywell’s innovative TIM technology provides customers with the ideal solution to optimize their phones’ performances,” said Olivier Biebuyck, VP and GM of Honeywell Electronic Materials. “As demand for smartphones grows around the world, these breakthrough designs help provide optimal user experience throughout the entire lifecycle of their devices.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The company’s PCM series of thermal management materials are based on sophisticated phase-change chemistry and advanced filler technology that was developed specifically for high-performing electronic devices. TIM products are designed to optimize thermal impedance across the entire thermal path, providing an end-to-end solution for best-in-class thermal performance. The PCM design can be customized to fit diverse product applications and end uses.
