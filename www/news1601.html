                            </i></h6>
                            <p>
                                SAINT-JEOIRE, France – January 15, 2016 – SET, Smart Equipment Technology, the leading supplier in high accuracy die-to-die and die-to-wafer bonders, today announced its participation in the 3D integration consortium of IRT Nanoelec, which is headed by CEA-Leti.  SET joins Leti, STMicroelectronics and Mentor Graphics to develop advanced 3D die-to-wafer stacking technologies, using direct copper-to-copper bonding.
                               </p>  <p>
                                Based in Grenoble, France, IRT Nanoelec is an R&D center focused on information and communication technologies (ICT) using micro- and nanoelectronics. 3D integration is one of its core programs.
                        </p>  <p>
                                The 3D integration program was launched in 2012. It brings together, under a single roof, expertise and equipment addressing the entire 3D integration value chain: technology, circuit architecture, EDA tools, packaging and test. Mentor Graphics (EDA), ST (foundry) and Leti are the founding members of the consortium.
                        </p>  <p>
                                “All SET employees, and in particular the team involved in the 3D project, are proud and enthusiastic to join IRT Nanoelec,” said Pascal Metzger, CEO of SET. “Our integration in this program is a logical continuation of the collaboration initiated with CEA teams 35 years ago on different bonding projects, including laboratory high-precision bonder for Cu-Cu direct bonding. One of the key factors for SET joining this consortium is the opportunity to meet and discuss with experts from different specialties.”
                        </p>  <p>
                                “Maintaining high accuracy for components assembly as well as good control of the parameters, while increasing dramatically the throughput, is a real challenge, but we are eager to start the daily work together with IRT teams to reach our mutual goals,” said Nicolas Raynaud, project manager at SET.
                        </p>  <p>
                                Séverine Chéramy, director of IRT Nanoelec’s 3D integration program, said the objective is to offer designers 3D die-to-wafer stacking at an aggressive pitch – less than 10µm – at high speed, at room temperature and without pressure or underfill.
                        </p>  <p>
                                “I’m particularly proud to welcome SET, a French SME, to the program, because it shows the complementarity of the scope of work,” she said. “The collaboration with SET on die-to-wafer bonding, using copper-to-copper bonding at very high accuracy and high speed, is really exciting and challenging. The consortium’s knowledge of such bonding techniques, combined with expertise on high-accuracy SET equipment, offers many opportunities for heterogeneous 3D integration that address a wide range of potential applications. These include imaging, sensors, logic and photonics.”

                            <h4> NANIUM’s latest WL3D solution reduces space required by 5X
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                            Vila do Conde, Porto, Portugal – January 14th, 2016 – NANIUM S. A., acknowledged for its experience in designing and developing innovative semiconductor packaging solutions, today announced it has developed a 3D Wafer-Level System-in-Package (WLSiP/WL3D) solution that integrates more than 40 different components. The final units measure 8 mm x 8 mm x 1 mm and are Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packages, produced on large diameter reconstituted wafers, a technology with proven volume manufacturability that was developed in-house.
                            </p><p>
                            “We were challenged by a customer to develop a package with several active and passive components including a large number of SMD parts - so far assembled on a PCB based module - in a single System-in-Package” explains Elisabete Fernandes, the responsible project manager. “To achieve a small form-factor, we had to attach an active silicon die as a hanging die (WLCSP) at the bottom side of the package inside the Ball Grid Array (BGA). The combination of these technologies enabled highly dense side-by-side (2D) and face-to-face (3D) assembly, ultimately reducing the original space required for this functionality by 5X.”
                        </p><p>
                            The resulting package was qualified and, according to the customer, NANIUM’s units not only achieve the same performance as the previously used PCB based module solution, but even exceed them in what concerns electrical performance. This was only possible due to the reliance on Wafer-Level Fan-Out (WLFO), the fastest-growing advanced packaging technology in the industry, capable of enabling Wafer-Level System-in-Package (WLSiP) and heterogeneous 3D integrated package solutions (WL3D).
                        </p><p>
                            This type of densely packed system solution is especially applicable to space constrained applications like wearables, health and well-being, sports and fitness, autonomous vehicles like cars and drones, and IoT devices in general.
                        </p><p>
                            NANIUM recently published a new datasheet “Embedded Wafer-Level System Integration (WLSiP & WL3D)”, and will be presenting the above solution at the “SEMI European 3D Summit”, along with other Wafer-Level Packaging technology innovations. The event will be held in Grenoble, France from January 18th to 20th, 2016.
