                            <h4> SMTA Announces Retirement of JoAnn Stromberg </h4>
                            <p>Minneapolis, MN, May 12, 2015 - The SMTA announced today that JoAnn Stromberg, the association’s Executive Administrator for the past 29 years, has announced plans to retire at the end of December 2015.
                            </p>

                            SMTA President, Bill Barthel (Plexus) comments, “I know I speak not only for our current Board of Directors, but for all past Directors as well when I say we cannot underestimate the many contributions made by JoAnn Stromberg to both the SMTA and our industry.  She has been tireless in her dedication to growing the SMTA membership, forming new chapters, and keeping the Board focused on the mission of the association. She has been our rudder in both calm and stormy water.  A former teacher, JoAnn has developed, along with our technical committees, some of the strongest technical conference programs in our industry.  The change and growth she has fostered for the Association and influence she has had on the overall industry is impossible to fully capture in this press release.” In 2012, ventureoutsource.com named JoAnn one of the EMS industry’s most influential people.
                        </p>  <p>
                            Barthel further commented, “JoAnn’s warm, caring, and outgoing personality has allowed her to make friends with thousands of our industry colleagues.  Many in our industry consider the SMTA a “family” as a result of JoAnn’s ability to be so inclusive and welcoming to all members and volunteers. The SMTA culture is unique in the industry in a large part due to JoAnn’s personal interest and support for everyone she worked with in and outside the Association.  We have been so fortunate to have such a strong and caring person lead our efforts for nearly three decades.  The SMTA Board of Directors wishes JoAnn a long, happy, healthy retirement.”
                        </p>  <p>
                            A celebration and recognition of JoAnn’s service will be held on Tuesday evening, September 29th in Rosemont, Illinois, in conjunction with SMTA International. Full details can be found at <a href="http://www.smta.org/celebration/joann/" target="Joaan">www.smta.org/celebration/joann/</a>. Registration will be available in June when SMTA International registration opens.
                        </p>  <p>
                            The Board has worked with JoAnn over the past year to ensure a smooth transition and is pleased to announce Tanya Martin, SMTA Director of Operations, will assume the role of Executive Administrator on January 1, 2016. JoAnn has been working closely with Tanya over the past year to ensure that she is informed and knowledgeable on all SMTA programs and activities.

                            <h4> JSR and imec Partner to Enable Next Generation EUV Lithography Resist Solutions </h4>
                            <p>
                                TOKYO, Japan and Leuven, Belgium – May 12, 2015 - JSR Corporation, a leading materials company and imec, a world-leading nanoelectronics R&D center, today signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to partner in enabling manufacturing and quality control of EUV lithography materials for the semiconductor industry. This partnership will be formalized by establishing a joint venture with imec as minority shareholder. The signing ceremony was held at the Embassy of the Kingdom of Belgium in Tokyo (Japan).
                            </p><p>
                                EUV lithography is considered as one of the main drivers to extend Moore’s law towards single digit nanometer technology nodes. Imec and JSR’s collaboration, will allow both companies to leverage their strengths when developing photoresist solutions for the semiconductor industry to manufacture the most advanced devices. JSR will provide manufacturing technology to the joint venture including upgrading the facility at its wholly-owned subsidiary in Belgium, JSR Micro NV, by installing manufacturing and analytical equipment. Imec will provide expertise and services to the joint venture for quality control on materials. In addition to the manufacturing of JSR brand photoresists, the joint venture will offer toll-manufacturing capability to other material suppliers with confidentiality secured.
                             </p><p>
                                 “JSR has been a strategic partner of imec for a long time, and I am excited with this intensified collaboration,” stated Luc Van den hove, president and CEO at imec. “This collaboration strengthens our supplier hub concept, a neutral open innovation R&D platform that involves suppliers more deeply and at an early stage of process step and module development. The partnership enabled through close proximity between the JSR manufacturing facility and the imec technology platform will allow our partners to gain access to best-in-class materials for next-generation technologies.”
                            </p><p>
                                    “We know that EUV lithography is required to realize Moore’s law in semiconductor manufacturing technologies and we continuously focus our R&D efforts to meet industry needs,” said Nobu Koshiba, President of JSR Corporation. “JSR has successfully developed not only chemically amplified photoresists, but also newly designed chemistries with very high sensitivity and good productivity. Our strength has also extended to peripheral materials, such as multilayer materials. The industry is requesting material suppliers to prepare manufacturing infrastructure and quality control capabilities for defect-free lithography solutions, as well as to improve photoresist performance to match EUV exposure equipment. It is by knowing those industry needs and requirements very well, that we, two world leading organizations that have supported the semiconductor industry for a long time, come to this unique idea to form a manufacturing joint venture to support those future industry needs. This is done based on our very long, trust-worthy relationship with imec. This is a very exciting challenge for us and I have great respect for imec for their brave and challenging spirits.”
