                            NANIUM S.A. recently announced the successful qualification of another type of wafer-level package (WLP) – called WLCSP+ – that is based on the company’s wafer-level fan-out (WLFO) technology, or, as the company characterizes it, a fusion of WLFO, high-volume manufacturing (HVM) capabilities, and classical wafer-level chip-scale packaging (WLCSP) technology. Regardless of the incoming wafer size, WLCSP+ is processed in a 300mm reconstituted wafer format. According to the company, the package has a thin mold compound layer over the die’s backside and sidewall, offering 5-sided mechanical protection (<b>Figures 1, 2</b>). The known-good dies (KGDs) (from the incoming wafers that had been  ground and diced) are placed together in a new, standardized, 300mm reconstituted mold wafer with a very short distance between each other. “The distance between dies can be as little as 120µm,” Steffen Kroehnert, Director of Technology at NANIUM, told <i>Chip Scale Review</i>. (I.e., a 30µm mold compound sidewall protection for the die on the left, a 60µm package singulation dicing street, and a 30µm mold compound sidewall protection for the die on the right.) “We recommend sidewall protection of at least a nominal 50µm—as with all tolerances, this has a minimum of only 30µm. In the case of a nominal 30µm, there would only be a worst case 10µm sidewall protection, which would not fulfill the purpose of increasing the die strength.”  </p>     <p style="text-indent:15px;">

                                “The idea of WLCSP+ was born during the second half of 2012,” said Kroehnert. “A customer with already singulated thick dies from multi-project wafers (MPWs) approached us asking for single-die thickness reduction and, if possible, also active surface cleaning and pad activation for the following wire bond process in a QFN package.” Kroehnert further explained that before WLFO was established in the market and ready for this type of construction, single-die processing was very difficult to accomplish and extremely costly. “The reconstituted wafer only requires a short distance between the dies and combines the single dies again into a wafer format, offering a very efficient way to complete the required modifications.”

                            <p style="text-indent:15px;">
                            In addition to the cost benefits, the company noted that the WLCSP+ concept is important for advanced CMOS technology nodes using low-k and ultra low-k (ULK) materials. “The mold compound protects the sidewalls of the die from chipping, as well as from propagation of layer delamination and cracks into the brittle low-k and ULK layers at the die surface, which are initiated by micro-cracks created during the silicon dicing process,” Kroehnert told <i>CSR</i>. The new technology also enables wafer-probe application to dies, already separated from the silicon wafer, now embedded in the reconstituted mold wafer. “With WLCSP+, the package singulation from the reconstituted mold wafer will be completed by dicing through the mold compound, after the already separated and tested silion dies have been coated by mold compound to ensure their protection.” WLCSP’s product applications include mobile and consumer products, wireless connectivity, MEMS, and sensors.
