                                <h4>IMAPS 2014 Explores the Future of Packaging </h4><p>[Chip Scale Review staff] </p>The 47th annual IMAPS 2014 International Symposium on Microelectronics convened at the Town and Country Resort and Convention Center in San Diego, CA on October 13 - 16, 2014. The theme of the event this year was "Future of Packaging." Dr. Subramanian S. Iyer, IBM Fellow and IMAPS 2014 Technical Chair, commented, "With classical silicon scaling saturating, and the cost per transistor, in some estimates potentially increasing, keeping the expectations of Moore's 'law' going for another decade or two will depend on how we successfully scale packages and boards."

They were joined by Dr. Rao Tummala of Georgia Tech and Dr. Bharath Rangarajan of Advanced Nanotechnology Solutions for a stimulating panel discussion on the "Future of Packaging."</div>
                                      The talks and discussions echoed a common theme that 2.5D and 3D packaging is the key to higher performance, smaller size, and lower costs needed to manufacture future portable, wearable, and mobile products developed
                                    for computing, medical, and communications applications which continue to drive the electronics industry.

                                  <p>IWLPC 2014 is shaping up to be the best year yet, and we invite you to join us! </p>
                                    <p>Sharpen your grasp on emerging technology at this year's IWLPC. Join us in Silicon Valley to interact with leaders of MEMS, 3D and Wafer-Level Packaging. Keynote presenter, Janusz Bryzek, also known as father of sensor technology, will speak on "Living Connected Through Trillions of Sensors." Choose from two days of parallel technical sessions which explore key topics under the three tracks. Enrich your grasp on current development in plenary sessions on MEMS and WLP, as well as through a 3D panel discussion.
                                      </p>
                                    <p>Throughout the conference, you will have opportunities to discuss growth possibilities in your industry with nearly sixty vendors of key materials, equipment and technology in the exhibit area.

                                    <p><strong>T1 - Wafer Level Packaging for MEMS and Microsystems Challenges and Opportunities    </strong>        <br>
                                      The ability to package ICs at the wafer-level has been a major contributor to size and cost reduction over the last 10 years. Significant technical challenges had to be overcome to realize these advantages in a production environment. The wafer-level packaging of MEMS and Microsystems also has contributed to the size and cost reduction of those devices, but with greater technical challenges and with a greater reward for overcoming those challenges. This course will review the general requirements for packaging of a variety of MEMS and Microsystem devices and will present methods to meeting those requirements with wafer-level packaging technologies. While research efforts and scientific principles will be at the heart of the discussion, the focus will be on practical implementation of the wafer-level package technology. Case studies will be used to illustrate major concepts. Wafer-level packaged devices covered in the course will include physical sensors such as pressure and inertial sensors, optical sensors and cameras, switches and RF devices as well as fluidic and biomedical devices.

                                      <p><strong>T2 - Wafer Level-Chip Scale Packaging (WL-CSP)        </strong>   <br>
                                      Wafer Level-Chip Scale Packaging (WL-CSP) has gained much success as a packaging form factor in the consumer arena in the past few years that it is almost considered as a "technology commodity." It has been driven by needs for cost reduction, size shrinkage, and enhanced performance. This course will provide an overview of the WL-CSP technology. The market drivers, benefits, and challenges facing industry-wide adoption will be discussed. The standard configurations will be reviewed in terms of their construction, manufacturing process, and published electrical and thermal performance, together with package and board level reliability.

                                       <p><strong>T3 - 3D IC Integration and Packaging         </strong>          <br>
                                       3D IC packaging and 3D IC integration are different. In general, the TSV (through-silicon via) separates 3D IC packaging from 3D IC integration because the latter use TSVs, but 3D IC packaging does not. TSV is the heart of 3D IC integration. It provides the opportunity for the shortest chip-to-chip, and the smallest pad size and pitch of interconnects. The potential high volume manufacturing of 3D IC integration is: (1) memory-chip stacking, (2) wide I/O memory (or logic-on-logic), (3) wide I/O DRAM, wide I/O 2, HMC, and HBM, and (4) wide I/O interface (or 2.5D IC integration). In this presentation, the supply chains and the critical steps such as FEOL, MOL, BEOL, TSV, MEOL (middle-end-of-line), assembly, and test and their ownerships for high-volume manufacturing for those four groups of 3D IC integration will be discussed. The 3D IC packaging, which has been keeping 3D IC integration away from volume production, will be briefly mentioned first. Key enabling technologies such as TSV forming and filling,           front and backside metallization, RDL, temporary bonding and de-bonding, and microbumping, assembly and reliability will be presented and discussed. All the materials are based on the papers and books published by the lecturer and others in the past three years.

                                        <p><strong>T4 - Achieving High Reliability for Lead-Free Solder Joints - Materials Consideration     </strong>   <br>
                                This course covers the detailed material considerations required for achieving high reliability for lead-free solder joints. The reliability discussed includes joint mechanical properties, development of type and extent of intermetallic compounds (IMC) under a variety of material combinations and aging conditions and how those IMCs affect the reliability. The failure modes, thermal cycling reliability, and fragility of solder joints as a function of material combination, thermal history, and stress history will be addressed in details, and novel alloys with reduced fragility will be presented. Electromigration and tin whisker will also be discussed. The emphasis of this course is placed on the understanding of how the various factors contributing to the failure modes, and how to select proper solder alloys and surface finishes for achieving high reliability. Also will be presented are the desirable future alloys and fluxes in order to meet the challenge of miniaturization.
