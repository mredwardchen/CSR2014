                                The biggest event for the semiconductor industry in Korea — SEMICON Korea — celebrated its 30th anniversary this year. The event took place February 8-10, 2017, at COEX in Seoul. It featured approximately 600 exhibiting companies and 40,000 attendees along with keynote speeches, the SEMI Technology Symposium (STS), Test Forum, Market Seminar, Smart Manufacturing Forum, System LSI Forum, Metrology Inspection Forum, and the Supplier Search Program.

                                In his keynote address, Sungjoo Hong, Executive VP and Head of R&D at SK hynix, talked about the increasing difficulties of scaling, and the alternative technologies developed to manage the move from “happy scaling” to “hard scaling.” Luc Van den hove, President & CEO of imec, said, “Moore’s legacy will be the heartbeat of the semiconductor industry for many more decades, enabled by 3D constructions with nanowire as vertical interconnects inside the die, but also by heterogeneous integration and fan-out wafer-level packaging (FOWLP).” Jan Vardaman, Founder and CEO of TechSearch International, said in her Market Briefing presentation (“The Future of Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packaging”), that by removing the substrate from the package, we are facing a new level of chip-package interaction (CPI) challenges, and need to factor this in for next technology nodes. 
                              </p>

                                Session 6 of the STS – with its theme “Electropackage System and Interconnect Product” – has been the most interesting with respect to packaging. The organizing committee of that session noted that, “As customers demand new electronic devices and performance enhancement, high-tech technology is required for package processes, which had been treated as simple manufacturing in the past. In the meantime, advanced wafer-level packaging is attracting attention as a future technology. This is due to its high cost competitiveness compared to existing packaging processes and the ability to package system-in-packages (SIPs).” As the first invited speaker of this session (“Where Is the Destination of the Packaging Technology”), Dr. Choon Heung Lee, Global CTO of Lam Research, said that in terms of FOWLP, it is all about manufacturing capacity. The technology is available and mature, and he observed that embedded multi-chip fan-out modules with optimized system design will be the future.
