                <h4> Amkor Technology Licenses Proprietary Copper Pillar Wafer Bump Technology to GLOBALFOUNDRIES </h4>



                <p></p>
                CHANDLER, Ariz.– December 16, 2014 -- Amkor Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMKR), a leading provider of semiconductor assembly and test services, today announced that it has granted GLOBALFOUNDRIES a non-exclusive license to its proprietary copper pillar wafer bump technology.  The agreement provides for the transfer of Amkor’s copper pillar wafer bump technology to GLOBALFOUNDRIES and a license under Amkor’s intellectual property to enable GLOBALFOUNDRIES to bump wafers based on this technology.
                </p>  <p>
                “Technology leadership and innovation are fundamental to Amkor’s success.  Since its introduction in 2010, our proprietary copper pillar wafer bump technology has been widely adopted for use in high volume production in many applications, including the smartphone and tablet markets,” said Dr. Choon Heung Lee, Amkor’s executive vice president and chief technology officer.  “We are pleased to license our copper pillar wafer bump technology to GLOBALFOUNDRIES, a world class, leading edge foundry.”
            </p>  <p>
                “GLOBALFOUNDRIES is committed to providing customers of our leading edge fab technology with fully integrated solutions.  Silicon to package integration is a key component of these solutions and we are pleased to have partnered with Amkor, a technology leader for outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services, to expand our wafer bumping services to include capabilities that can further extend our copper pillar bump manufacturing,” said David McCann, Vice President of Packaging R&D at GLOBALFOUNDRIES.  “Semiconductor device scaling drives higher density off chip interconnect requirements.  Copper pillar bumping is a critical part of bringing leading edge semiconductor devices to market and this capability enhances our growing open ecosystem of manufacturing services and partners.”
            </p>  <p>
                Amkor’s copper pillar wafer bump technology enables low profile and small area packaging, which is required for the mobile device market.  Copper pillar technology supports 3D fine pitch memory interfaces and is utilized in 2.5D packaging where fine pitch multi-die interconnects can reduce system level costs and shorten time-to-market as compared to SoC platforms.  In addition, Amkor’s copper pillar wafer bump technology supports substantial die-to-die bandwidth between memory and logic devices, greatly reduces power consumption in high-performance products, and enables high speed interfaces when applied to analog and RF applications.

                        <h4> 8 GHz Bandwidth Socket for Hybrid Memory Cube </h4>
                        <p>

                            Eagan, MN - December, 2014 - Ironwood Electronics has recently introduced a new high performance BGA socket for Hybrid Memory Cube (1mm pitch, 900 pin BGA). A hybrid memory cube (HMC) is a single package containing either four or eight DRAM die and one logic die, all stacked together using through-silicon via (TSV) technology. The SG-BGA-6412 socket is designed for 31x31mm package size with 30x30 ball array and operates at bandwidths up to 8 GHz with less than 1dB of insertion loss. The sockets are designed to dissipate up to several watts without extra heat sinking and can handle up to 100 watts with custom heat sink. The contact resistance is typically 20 milliohms per pin. The socket connects all pins with 8 GHz bandwidth on all connections. The socket is mounted on the target PCB with no soldering, and uses industry's smallest footprint (only 2.5mm more on each side). The socket is constructed with shoulder screw and swivel lid which incorporates a quick insertion method so that IC's can be changed out quickly.
                        </p><p>
                        <img class="pull-left" src="assets/images/news/2014-12/ironwood-socket-l.jpg" width="200" alt=""/>
                        The SG-BGA-6412 socket is constructed with high performance and low inductance elastomer contactor. The temperature range is -35 C to +100 C. The pin self inductance is 0.15 nH and mutual inductance of 0.025 nH. Capacitance to ground is 0.01 pF. Current capacity is 2 amps per pin. Works with IC's such as Micron's HMC in BGA package with 30x30 array and 1mm pitch.
                    </p><p>
                        Pricing for the SG-BGA-6412 is $896 at qty 1; with reduced pricing available depending on quantity required.

                        <h4>  Push-pin heat sinks offer more than 100,000 configurations </h4>







                        Norwood, MA -- With 108,000 possible configurations, Advanced Thermal Solutions, Inc. (ATS) now provides the widest choice of push pin-mounted heat sinks for cooling BGAs and other hot components.
                        <p>
                            More than 200 ATS heat sinks are available with convenient push pin mounting. The lightweight aluminum heat sinks include straight fin, cross-cut, and ATS maxiFLOW spread fin geometries. More than 100 fine- pitch heat sinks are available for effective cooling in high velocity airflows. For low airflow conditions, another 100 sinks are available with coarse-pitch fins and wide fin spacing. The full range of heat sinks is sized for cooling components in lengths from 25-70 mm.
                        </p><p>
                        <img class="pull-left" src="assets/images/news/2014-12/PushPinHeatSinkfromATS-1.JPG" width="150" alt=""/>
                        All ATS push pin heat sinks feature pre-drilled holes for secure mounting to PCBs in industry standard locations. To meet application needs, push pins are available in both durable plastic and brass. Plastic pins are lighter and non-electrically conductive. Metal pins have added strength and durability for more rugged applications or thicker devices. All push pins feature flexible barbs that lock securely in PCB holes.
                    </p><p>
                        Compression springs on the push pins add the required forces for firm attachment and effective heat transfer. These springs come in 21 sizes to provide the precise forces needed to optimize heat sink performance on different PCBs.

                        ATS push pin heat sinks are pre-assembled with a phase-change thermal interface material to increase heat transfer. Double-sided thermal tape and no TIM options are available for application specific requirements.
