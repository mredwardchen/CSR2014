                                <b>Belle étoile, Alpexpo, Grenoble, France - October 25–26, 2016</b>  - Advanced packaging technology development has always been driven by the consumer market, namely by mobile and wireless communication applications, always targeting to find solutions for those key critical aspects of packaging: Performance, Form-Factor and Cost. Years after introduction of new advanced packaging technologies, typically after a certain level of maturity and wider acceptance was achieved, other markets such as industrial, medical and healthcare, automotive and even military and aerospace tended to re-use those technologies, adapted to their typically higher requirements. Why did they do so, and do so even more today? Because they are under the same continuously increasing pressure to address that critical triad of packaging: Performance, Form-Factor and Cost.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The major differences compared to consumer packaging can be found in the performance and reliability requirements. To address those, Chip-Package-Interaction (CPI) needs to be better understood. The experts of Semiconductor Wafer FABs and IDMs (Frontends) and Packaging, Assembly and Test in OSATs and IDMs (Backends) need to move closer together, new high sophisticated functional materials need to be developed and tested for higher system robustness, new more powerful inspection methods are needed to ensure the quality level required, and flexible multi-temperature test concepts need to be developed. The balancing act is to achieve the higher performance and reliability requirements without over-engineering the solutions, and that way keep the cost at least close to consumer packaging level.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                From this year onwards, the Advanced Packaging Conference committee will get reinforced by test experts, and test topics interacting with advanced packaging technology will be covered in a separate session inside APC.
