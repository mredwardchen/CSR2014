                            <h4> WinWay Technology Acquires Wentworth Laboratories Saber Probe-based Vertical Probe Card Products ® </h4>
                            <p><strong> Acquisition of complimentary technology strengthens WinWay product portfolio and expands total available market for semiconductor test products.
                                </strong></p>
                            <p>Kaohsiung City, Taiwan (R.O.C.) - November 18, 2014   <br>
                            <p>WinWay Technology Co., Ltd., a global supplier of high performance IC (integrated circuit) sockets, test interfaces and semiconductor test services, has acquired the SaberProbe-based vertical probe card assets and related intellectual property of Wentworth Laboratories, Inc. ("Wentworth"), which is headquartered in Brookfield, CT, USA.  An early test industry pioneer, Wentworth is a global supplier of probe cards and wafer probing products for the semiconductor test industry.  The acquisition of Wentworth SaberProbe-based vertical probe card products immediately and substantially increases WinWay Technology's total available market, and is expected to assist in the penetration of vertical probe card markets while providing additional scope and performance advantages for existing product lines. </p>
                            <p>The acquisition includes all patents and trademarks associated with Wentworth Verimax™, Accumax,and Micromax® vertical probe card products.  At the core of Wentworth's vertical probe card technology and central to this acquisition is the proprietary SaberProbe, a photo mask-defined, chemically etched probe that enables its vertical probe cards to deliver robust overall electrical performance with longevity. WinWay Technology and Wentworth customers are poised to benefit from both company's well established global service and support and continuing commitment to quality SaberProbe-based vertical probe card manufacture. </p>
                            <p>      Mark Wang, WinWay Technology Founder and Chief Executive Officer commented, "Wentworth is a globally known supplier of advanced probing products with a proven vertical probe card platform.  This acquisition furthers our goal of expanding our total available market and increasing our customer base." Mr. Wang added, "SaberProbe-based vertical probe card technology complements WinWay Technology's socket products as well, and this is only one area where we anticipate cost, efficiency and performance advantages to be realized as a result."</p>
                            <p>"Wentworth's patented SaberProbe-based vertical technology has been production proven in many extreme test environments", said Stephen Evans, Wentworth Laboratories Chief Executive Officer. "SaberProbe-based vertical probe cards were engineered to meet our customers' most complex technical challenges."  Mr. Evans continued, "There is exceptional synergy between Wentworth Verimax products
                                in particular and the strategic vision and capabilities of WinWay.  This transaction benefits all stakeholders of Wentworth Laboratories and WinWay Technology, including our dedicated employees and our valued customers."®</p>
