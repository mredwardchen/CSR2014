                            <h4>TI demonstrates leadership in copper wire bonding technology
                                with more than 22B units shipped</h4>

                            <p><strong>Extends copper wire production into high reliability applications including
                                automotive and industrial</strong></p>

                            <p>Dallas,TX - October 14, 2014 - Texas Instruments (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today announced it
                                has shipped more than 22 billion units of copper wire bonding technology from its
                                internal assembly sites and is now in production for major high reliability applications
                                including automotive and industrial. The majority of TI's existing analog and CMOS
                                silicon technology nodes have been qualified with copper, and all new TI technologies
                                and packages are being developed with copper wire bond. Along with its quality,
                                reliability and cost benefits, copper wire offers equal or better manufacturability
                                compared to gold. It also delivers 40 percent higher electrical conductivity to give
                                customers a boost in overall product performance with a number of TI's analog and
                                embedded processing parts.
                            </p>

                            <p>"TI has pioneered development of copper wire bonding for high volume production across a
                                broad portfolio of products, factories and technologies," said Jan Vardaman, president
                                and founder of TechSearch International, Inc. "TI was one of the first manufacturers to
                                recognize the many advantages copper wire technology offers a customer. For example, it
                                provides more thermal stability than gold and has superior mechanical properties to
                                increase bond strength."
                            </p>

                            <p>TI is currently shipping about two billion units of copper wire bond technology each
                                quarter. This includes production for key automotive segments such as safety (e.g.,
                                anti-lock brake systems, power steering, stability control), infotainment, body and
                                comfort, and powertrain. Enabling copper wire bond technology for automotive
                                applications requires significant development to automotive standards and strict
                                manufacturing discipline. TI's extensive manufacturability and reliability testing meets
                                automotive industry qualification requirements and includes thorough process corner
                                development, production quality and reliability monitoring, and manufacturing controls.
                            </p>

                            <p>TI began shipping copper wire in its products in 2008. Today, all of TI's assembly and
                            test (A/T) sites are running copper wire bonding on all TI package types, including BGA,
                            QFN, QFP, TSSOP, SOIC, PDIP and others. Copper is at 71 percent of TI's total wire usage and
                            TI is in production with:
                            <p> * Minimum 30/60 microns staggered bond pad pitch <br>
                                * Up to 1000 wires in BGA packages <br>
                                * Multi-chip stacked die with die to die wire bonding <br>
                                * Minimum 0.8mil copper wire diameter <br></p>

                            <p> "Having multiple wire bond capabilities that support a wide range of silicon
                                technologies and product applications is a great benefit to our customers," said Devan
                                Iyer, director of Semiconductor Packaging in TI's Technology & Manufacturing Group.
                                "TI's flexible manufacturing strategy also improves customer delivery and performance
                                for products using copper wire bond. We have a clear capacity advantage, both internally
                                and with qualified subcontractors, that enable us to meet all levels of customer
                                demand."

                                <p><strong>Challenges with Combining Compound Semiconductors and Silicon </strong></p>

                                <p>Combining materials with different properties to produce electronic devices, such as
                                    III-V compound semiconductor materials like gallium nitride (GaN), gallium arsenide
                                    (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP) with silicon substrates, can lead to enhanced
                                    device performance due to higher carrier mobility as well as open up new
                                    capabilities such as the emission of light through silicon, which can enable optical
                                    interconnects and routers. However, combining these materials through traditional
                                    epitaxial growth processes leads to crystal dislocation defects due to differences
                                    in lattice constant and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), which in turn
                                    degrade performance.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Benefits of Wafer Bonding </strong>

                                <p>These manufacturing issues can be mitigated by growing each semiconductor material
                                    separately on optimized growth substrates and then combining them through wafer
                                    bonding. Room-temperature covalent bonding, in particular, is an ideal choice since
                                    it eliminates the need for annealing processes, which generate high temperatures
                                    that can add additional stress due to CTE mismatch. However, a key limitation of
                                    room-temperature covalent bonding has been the inability to maintain tight control
                                    of the thickness and uniformity of the bond interface layer, including effective
                                    removal of particle contaminants and the native oxide layers, which is necessary in
                                    order to achieve an interface that has both sufficient bond strength and electrical
                                    conductivity between the bonded materials. The EVG580 ComBond addresses these
                                    limitations.
                                </p>
