                                        <h4> SEMI Seminar Focuses on European Packaging, Assembly and Test</h4>
                                                <p>
                                                Grenoble, France — On June 18, the SEMI Packaging Tech Seminar will take place in Vila do Conde, Portugal. Organized by SEMI Europe (www.semi.org/eu/), the event will be hosted by NANIUM S.A., Europe’s leading Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT). More than 100 industry professionals are expected at the event, which is dedicated to packaging, assembly, and test, with a focus on large format Fan-Out Packaging. In addition, European back-end organizations with manufacturing in Europe will have an opportunity to present corporate capabilities.
                                                </p><p>
                                                The morning session will showcase the European packaging, assembly and test industry.  Rozalia Beica of Yole Développement will present a market overview of the sector in Europe. Twelve SEMI members with manufacturing centers in Europe or European Equipment and Manufacturing companies with activities in packaging, assembly and test, will present.
                                                 </p><p>
                                                 The afternoon session will highlight large format Fan-Out Packaging, going beyond mainstream 200 and 300mm round wafer level packaging. Fan-Out Packaging technologies have gained momentum in recent years, with major OSATs, and even the largest wafer foundries, proposing Fan-Out Packaging solutions as part of their technology portfolio. Jan Vardaman (TechSearch International) will deliver the keynote presentation “The Movement to Large Array Packaging: Opportunities and Options.” The session will also feature presentations from research and technology organizations and equipment and materials companies, who will share viewpoints and recent achievements regarding the production of round rebuilt panels greater than 300mm and rectangular rebuilt panels. Speakers will include representatives from Fraunhofer IZM, Rudolph Technologies, SPTS, and SUSS MicroTec.
                                                  </p><p>
                                                 The presentations will be followed by several networking opportunities, including a Fab Tour of the   NANIUM S.A. Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) manufacturing floor, plus a guided tour and networking dinner in the ancient downtown of Porto. Throughout the day, event sponsors will promote their packaging activities at a dedicated tabletop exhibition area.

                                                  “Europe is the home of a full back-end supply chain, including internationally renowned equipment and materials companies, research institutes, service providers and numerous packaging, assembly and test manufacturing companies,” stated Heinz Kundert, president of SEMI Europe. “By inviting our members to this Packaging Tech Seminar, we are aiming to enhance the growth of the European Packaging industry by proposing a platform for the development of business and collaborative opportunities.”
                                                 </p><p>
                                                  Armando Tavares, president of NANIUM’s Executive Board commented, “We have been a member of SEMI for many years, and are very pleased that we were selected as event hosts for the second time. Our industry ensures the competitiveness of sectors that are crucial for Europe, such as Automotive, Aerospace and Banking.  The EU's 10/100/20 vision would greatly benefit from investing across the whole semiconductor supply chain, where Packaging, Assembly and Test is playing a more crucial and value-adding role than ever before.”
                                                 </p><p>
                                                 On June 19, attendees will have the additional opportunity to participate in the ESPAT (European Semiconductor Packaging Assembly and Test) Industry Interest Group meeting. SEMI will participate in this meeting, dedicated to advancing the interests of the European Packaging Industry and with the eventual goal of creating a SEMI-SIG (Special Interest Group).
                                                 </p><p>
                                                 SEMI Tech Seminars are open to everyone and free of charge for SEMI members.
